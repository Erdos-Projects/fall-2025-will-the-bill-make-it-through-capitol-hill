1nlh00m,I would love to see the current numbers after the past week,"From a month ago….

“The Democratic Party is hemorrhaging voters long before they even go to the polls.

Of the 30 states that track voter registration by political party, Democrats lost ground to Republicans in every single one between the 2020 and 2024 elections — and often by a lot.

That four-year swing toward the Republicans adds up to 4.5 million voters, a deep political hole that could take years for Democrats to climb out from.

Democrats went from nearly an 11-percentage-point edge over Republicans on Election Day 2020 in those places with partisan registration, to just over a 6-percentage-point edge in 2024.
That swing helps to explain President Trump’s success last year, when he won the popular vote for the first time, swept the swing states and roared back to the White House.

“I don’t want to say, ‘The death cycle of the Democratic Party,’ but there seems to be no end to this,” said Michael Pruser, who tracks voter registration closely as the director of data science for Decision Desk HQ, an election-analysis site. “There is no silver lining or cavalry coming across the hill. This is month after month, year after year.”

1gmyone,"[Insider's info] As a REAL POLITICAL REFUGEE, I am CONSERVATIVE (by two real life observations)","Short Introduction about me: 
I was born in April, 2006. I am known as the activist “Fragile Bard” on The Epoch Times and Radio Free Asia. I arrived in the US on August 13th, 2022. The National Security Department of Hong Kong Police Force entered my home with a search warrant with the charge of “sedition”, after I posted videos criticizing Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party in February, 2022. The national security officer keeps persuading me to work for them and assist them with the investigation on other dissidents, in exchange the government can pardon me for my disobedience to the Chinese Communist Party. But I did not want to exchange temporary safety by going against my own conscience, so I fled. I picked the US, since it has the strongest military in the world, also US politics is basically world politics. I have a dream to join the US military (preference: Air Force &gt; Army &gt; Navy) and defend liberty and the US Constitution. For me fleeing is just retreating, and retreating is not giving up, I would not give up the task to uphold the founding values of America, shared by humanity. (BTW, I have registered for selective service. I hope that I can sign up for voluntary service as soon as possible. USA! USA! USA!)

Part 1:
When I arrived at SFO, I immediately claimed asylum status at the ICE checkpoint. Most of the officers were nice, especially when I was underage, but a Chinese officer was picking at me. She said that she did not believe in my story because I was young, and the Chinese government “would not persecute minors”. (Five teenagers have been sentenced to three years' detention in Hong Kong for delivering leaflets opposing the CCP. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63186293 ) I have a question, are the woke going to blame the Whites for a Chinese American speaking for the CCP with lies? 

Since asylum is immigrationally intended, it contradicts the condition for a tourist visa. ICE arrested me and gave me a notice to appear. They sent me to a “shelter” for minors run by an organization that is funded by the federal government which serves as a juvenile detention center for immigrants, minors ranging from 12 to 17 years old, are grouped together arbitrarily regardless of their backgrounds. Most of the detainees crossed the US-Mexico border, and came for economic reasons with plans to work illegally. (They overtly admitted it and were very proud of it.) Most of the detainees in the shelter are released within one to two weeks, and most of them are Hispanic. 

At least for my case, they did not really ask any questions about how I am going to obtain legal residency in the US, very likely not for those who are released quickly, I was not able to file an asylum application (form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal) in the facility, since my devices containing the evidences and passport were all confiscated. And my time in shelter is much longer than the national average according to statistics conducted by the US government. The only question I have been asked repeatedly is “Do you eat dog meat in China?”. The people who asked were the same group of people who were yelling that Trump is racist. I have also heard countless “chinito” and “ch*ngch*ng”.

(Latest UC data – FY2024. (2024, August 28). United States Department of Health and Human Services. https://www.hhs.gov/programs/social-services/unaccompanied-children/latest-uc-data-fy2024/index.html )

The staff and detainees are mostly Hispanic. According to ABC News, a lot of the kids lost contact, missed immigration court hearings, and despised the laws of the US. I was detained for three months. More than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear for their immigration court hearings, which is even more than the minors released to sponsors in Fiscal Year 2015. 

(Fact sheets and data. (2024, July 5). The Administration for Children and Families. https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data )

(Levine, M., Bruggeman, L., &amp; Romero, L. (2024, August 20). DHS watchdog warns of “urgent issue” after immigration officials allegedly lose track of unaccompanied children. ABC News. https://abcnews.go.com/US/dhs-watchdog-warns-urgent-issue-after-immigration-officials/story?id=112964072 )

According to Freedom House (funded by the US government), only Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela are “not free”, and overall they are still freer than China and Iran. Most of the migrants I saw in the shelter from Latin America, are not from the four mentioned countries above. 

https://freedomhouse.org/explore-the-map?type=fiw&amp;year=2024 

If you are a real political refugee, you would not want your plan to flee, fearing that the dictatorial government might know. So when they flee, they probably do not have the time to find a trustworthy sponsor who is safe to know about the plan. The decision of whether a juvenile should be released has not much relationship with his background nor his eligibility to obtain legal residency like asylum. Also, if someone is a real political refugee who is granted the protection of his life and liberty by America, in common sense he would be grateful and want to be very American, at least learn English. But Most of the migrants in the shelter showed an attitude that they do not have to nor want to learn English. 

Ironically, in community college, my English professor let students write an essay about the book, Illegally Yours by Rafael Agustin, who was an illegal immigrant who overstayed in the US with a tourist visa. According to what he wrote, he was working illegally, he had once stolen a pornographic magazine from a store, and drove a motor vehicle without a driver 's license. He traveled to Tijuana and returned to the US while being undocumented. Yet, he received his green card. In his book, Agustin claimed that America plays the minorities and controls the Latin American countries by puppets. 

When the radical-left said that we should accept all immigrants because of sympathy, when did they speak for those who are really fleeing from the political persecutions of America’s enemies? 

When I expressed that I am unhappy in the incarcerated situation, the therapist under the NGO (her parents are immigrants from Mexico, she was raised in the US) made the following statements, “Who told you to fight for freedom?”, “The reason why you are here does not make you special”. She was so strongly opposed to Trump, that she does not even like to hear the word “Trump”. 

After refusing to the request from other detainees to make sexual comments about female staffs in the facilities, I started facing constant sexual harassment. One time, some 17 years old teenagers invited me to go visit prostitutes, the original wordings were “go f*ck mad b*tches with us”, which the weekly event was claimed to be leaded by staffs , after refusing it, I started facing constant rape threats along with accusation saying that I am a homosexual in a disparage manner. I was sexually assaulted with several touches (including direct and indirect) or observations of genitals by force. When the abuses happened, other detainees (again, mostly Hispanic) were just laughing. 

The one who led the bullying was from Romania, a country of the European Union, with democratic elections and freedom of speech. He decided to return to his home country since he does not want to wait, and returning is not dangerous at all. He was angry when he found out that I came by visa. He said that since I did not walk through the US-Mexico border, my life was not as hard as his. He also said that I was a troublemaker to my family that my parents did not support my trip and tried to turn me into the Communist Communist Party, he also stated that he “don’t give a f*ck” about my advocacy for freedom. He also praised those who were illegal entrants who were trying to work illegally in the US, even without license as electricians. He claimed that he was a drug dealer in Romania, and he overtly claimed that he came for money. He also blamed me for trying to let the Hispanic migrants learn English.

Those people claim that they came to the US because they are poor and starving in their home country. Yet, they are taller, and heavier and were able to bully an underweight political refugee kid. What kind of starveds are they? “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength”. Sex offenders and tall bullies are poor starving children. 

After three months, I was released to a Mexican foster family with three other foster kids, all are Hispanic teenage boys who can do chores well, the foster mother could not speak English fluently. After reporting a racist incident in the foster home, the foster mother was angry and expelled me. She did not make any defense about her racist speech against me. Radical left needs to stop blaming everything on Whites. 

Eventually, a white couple fostered me and gave me a home. When the school biology started talking about what is sex trafficking and how much sex trafficking happens in the US every year. I could not hold it anymore, I told my foster parent more about a lot of things I have experienced in the shelter. 

It is really hard for me to believe the leftists’ claim of “White men are the root of evil.” When the people abusing and mistreating me are mostly non-Whites, when the people who helped me a lot are Whites. If loving my foster parents who have loved me is considered white-supremacy, I am proud to be the first transracial White in human history. Howdy Y’all, I identify myself as a heterosexual, cisgender, Christian White male. Yeehaw!

Local police department reported the case to the California Department of Social Services, CDSS sent an investigator (also Hispanic) to interview me. The investigator told me that the system is handling too many kids and they can do nothing about it when I was crying, and the system should not treat better kids with better support because it is unfair. It is proven again that, leftists think migrating to the US is something everyone deserves, and those who can do it while complying with the law are just like, very similar to their ideas about “critical racial theory”, “critical racial theory” is unfair to Whites, completely opposite to the concept of merit-based. If migrating to the US is entitled to everyone, why do asylum seekers need to prove their case to the government? Tying economic migrants who have little loyalty and unwillingness to learn English with patriotic political refugees who have nowhere else to go is extremely unfair to those who fought for liberty while sacrificing their own family, career, school, friendship and a lot more. 

My social worker told me that the investigation had ended, but I have not yet received any results nor updates. 

In the three months in shelter, I was not enrolled into any public school district. I graduated high school in Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, one of the best public high schools in the US with a GPA of 4.0962 (weighted), with five AP classes. AP Calculus BC: 5, AP Computer Science Principles: 5, AP US Government: 4, AP Microeconomics: 4 and AP Chinese: 5. I was accepted by Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach and Bakersfield, but I could not afford the tuition. When I was looking for a scholarship, I was surprised that I could not benefit from the CA Dream Act, even DACA recipients are eligible. When I selected that I have a social security number and I am not a DACA recipient, the system said that they cannot determine my eligibility status.

The theme of this part is not about hating Hispanic people, but to raise awareness about identity politics. The thing that makes America great would definitely not and will never be about identity politics like “Oh! if you are Hispanic or Black, any bad things you do is because of the oppression from the Whites, therefore are justifiable. Of! If you are White, you are evil, and you don’t deserve what you have.” It is a shame to Hispanic and African Americans who worked hard. Same, if a Chinese American said that anti-CCP is racist to Chinese, I would strongly oppose that idea. I would not silently accept CCP supporters using the name of “Stop Asian-hate” to tie every Asian in America, to push their agenda that is going to benefit the CCP, and not liking to benefit the patriotic Asian, especially people from Hong Kong and China. Stop using the tag of “racist” to avoid data and facts. 

Part 2: 
Yuen Hong Tam is a young activist (I helped him while he is in the US) who has been actively involved in the “Great Translation Movement” which is dedicated to exposing China's inward propaganda and false information, as well as extreme Chinese nationalism including overt threats and schemes of violent attack on Americans on American soil. A Chinese student who is admitted by Columbia University claimed on Chinese social media in Chinese that he is going to “buy guns and kill Americans”, luckily his speech was translated and his offer of admission was withdrawn, otherwise a lot of Americans may die because of an avoidable attack.

I wrote a letter to House Reps. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.), Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). Only Michelle Steel replied. “As a Member of the Congressional Executive Commission on China (CECC) and a strong supporter of human rights, I’ve been working with my colleagues to bring awareness to threats posed by the CCP,” she responded. Actually I sent the message to Steel on her website. I gave a hard copy in person to Sherman’s assistant and Ted Lieu in person in an open event. Yet, I have not yet received a word from them.

As China has severe internet censorship, the residents of China are not able to use foreign platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Instagram as well as western media websites like BBC and CNN. Therefore, the tone of China’s state media inward and outward can be completely different. For example, English media backed by the Chinese government would remain relatively neutral about the Russo-Ukrainian War, but the state media on Chinese platforms, writing in Chinese, outrageously support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If there is no one translating open-source Chinese information into English, the United States would be at a huge disadvantage of asymmetric information.

He arrived in San Francisco in March 2024 with a tourist visa, he claimed asylum during the entry checking. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained him and sent him to the detention center, Golden State Annex. On July 9th, an immigration judge announced that the immigration court has no power to conduct a bond hearing as he is an “arriving alien” according to the immigration law, because he did not cross the border illegally.

He is from Hong Kong, under the brutal rule of the Chinese Communist Party. He voluntarily put himself into risk to defend democratic values and to warn free countries including the United States of the coming, unknown danger. He protected America's national security interests without getting paid. It is important for Congress to support open-source translation programs that helped Americans understand both our allies and our adversaries. The Open Translation Act of 2024 (H.R.7942) suggested to establish a federally funded research center that will be charged with creating publicly-accessible translations of open-source materials (including speeches from government officials, official proclamations, and other documents) from China, Russia, and other nations of strategic interest to the United States. But under the unfair immigration legal system, as someone who did not cross the border illegally, and passed through the background check during applying for visa, he could not be released as easily as those who crossed the border illegally.

(9.3 - bond proceedings. (2023, June 23). United States Department of Justice. https://www.justice.gov/eoir/reference-materials/ic/chapter-9/3 )

Eventually his bond was set as $12,500 USD, which is unusually high for illegal entrants and actual criminals.

Tam’s case was used by China’s propaganda machine to defame the United States and suggest that the people under the Chinese Communist Party can only submit themselves to the CCP. Quote: “Absolutely hilarious to the extreme that you spread hatred, misportray Chinese people, simp for the extreme for the US and then they detain you for illegal immigration and you discover they don't treat you like a human being after all.”, “Never trust those who betray their own fellow countrymen.”

The definition of treason is to “provide aid and comfort to enemies of the United States”, in this case, such traitorous aid and comfort to CCP’s propaganda has been provided overtly. It is not reasonably possible that it is merely coincidence that the employees of the US immigration institute had mistreated innocent people who are beneficial to the US, and let people who are going to harm the US in easily. People who fought for American values and the liberty, safety and future of American people are being mistreated even worse than those who intentionally breach the law of the land for their self-oriented interest.",Electronic_River9540,Conservative,1731115433.0,25,11,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gmyone/insiders_info_as_a_real_political_refugee_i_am/,['H.R.7942'],reddit_improved

My particular concern is in regards to constitutional checks and balances: whether the Executive and the Legislative branches are wielding proportionate power that can rein in one another; but feel free to point out pros and cons in other political contexts.  
  
I have heard a lot of chatter advocating for voting ""no"" on this Continuing Resolution \(CR\).  
Over [an interview with Chris Hayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&amp;t=59), Senator Schumer \(D-NY\) claimed voting ""no"" leads to a shutdown, and this would allow the Exec. branch to arbitrarily and unilaterally (albeit temporarily, see below) determine which government functions are essential \(or not\), quickly shutting down a wide swarth of agencies and forcing workers out by furlough (unpaid time-off).  

However, on [his opinion piece published on NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/trump-musk-shutdown-senate.html), he claimed that should the shutdown drag on, it would be up to Congress to make those determinations.  
&gt;In a protracted shutdown, House and Senate Republicans could bring bills to the floor to reopen only their favored departments and agencies while leaving other vital services that they don’t like to languish[,]  
  
wrote Sen. Schumer. It seems to me that is one way for the Legislature to retain some measure of control.  

On the other hand, should the CR pass, it will mean strengthening the Exec. branch and weakening the Legislative.  
&gt;“It is not a simple stopgap that keeps the lights on and the doors open,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “This is Republican leadership handing over the keys of the government, and a blank check to Elon Musk and to President Trump.”

While the dollar amount is much smaller, in [an interview with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/politics/ocasio-cortez-schumer-democratic-shutdown-plan/index.html), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \(D, NY-14\) emphasized that it would mean Congress codifying its abdication of power to the Executive.

1hipel3,Connecting Indoor Farming Benefits to the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 4319),"**Concise Summary of H.R. 4319, Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2023 (as Introduced):**

**Purpose:** To stabilize the agricultural workforce by providing a path to legal status for undocumented farmworkers, reforming the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program,

The expansion of indoor farming, coupled with a well-managed foreign worker program, can significantly boost self-reliance, strengthen the farm-to-table movement, and foster competition, ultimately benefiting consumers with lower prices and fresher produce.

**Connecting Indoor Farming Benefits to the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 4319):**

While H.R. 4319 primarily focuses on traditional agriculture, several provisions could indirectly support the growth of indoor farming and its associated benefits:

1. **Stable Workforce for Indoor Farms:**
   * **H-2A Visa Reforms:** The bill's reforms to the H-2A program, including the potential for year-round visas and the pilot program for portable visas, could provide a more stable and flexible labor supply for indoor farms. Although the bill specifically mentions the dairy industry, these provisions, if successful, could provide a template for other year-round agricultural sectors, such as indoor farming, to be included. This could be a useful point of future advocacy if this bill were to be used as a template for addressing labor in other industries.
   * **CAW Status:** The creation of Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) status could, in the long term, lead to a pool of experienced agricultural workers, some of whom might transition to indoor farming as the industry expands.
2. **Reduced Reliance on Long-Distance Transportation:**
   * **Indirect Support:** The bill doesn't directly address transportation. However, by supporting a more stable agricultural workforce, it could indirectly facilitate the growth of local food systems, including indoor farms that supply nearby urban centers. This aligns with the goal of reducing reliance on long-distance transportation of produce.
3. **Increased Competition and Lower Prices:**
   * **Indirect Impact:** A more robust agricultural sector, supported by a reliable workforce, could lead to increased competition among producers, including indoor farmers. This could potentially translate into lower prices and greater variety for consumers.

**Limitations of H.R. 4319 in Directly Addressing Indoor Farming:**

* **Focus on Traditional Agriculture:** The bill's primary focus is on traditional, outdoor agriculture. It doesn't explicitly address the unique needs and challenges of the indoor farming sector.
* **Specialized Skills:** The bill doesn't specifically address the specialized skills often required in indoor farming (e.g., hydroponics, technology integration). The H-2A program, as reformed by the bill, may not be perfectly suited to attract workers with these specific skill sets.
* **Year-Round Visas:** While the bill expands year-round H-2A visas for the dairy industry, it doesn't explicitly include indoor farming, though the framework established could set a precedent.

**How Future Legislation Could Better Support Indoor Farming:**

Building on the principles of H.R. 4319, future legislation could more directly support the growth of indoor farming and its benefits by:

1. **Explicitly Including Indoor Farming:**
   * **Defining Indoor Farming:** Clearly define indoor farming or controlled environment agriculture (CEA) in relevant legislation.
   * **Extending H-2A Reforms:** Explicitly extend the year-round H-2A visa provisions, or similar provisions adapted for the specific needs of indoor farms to the indoor farming sector. For example, a provision could be created for indoor farming similar to that of (i)(2)(B), which establishes a reserve for dairy labor or services.
2. **Addressing Specialized Skills:**
   * **Skills-Based Visas:** Create visa pathways or modify existing ones to attract foreign workers with specific skills relevant to indoor farming technology and operations.
   * **Training Programs:** Fund training programs to develop a skilled domestic workforce for the indoor farming industry.
3. **Promoting Research and Development:**
   * **Funding for Innovation:** Allocate funding for research and development in indoor farming technologies, including automation, to enhance productivity and create new, high-skilled jobs.
4. **Ensuring Worker Protections:**
   * **Tailored Safety Standards:** Develop and enforce safety standards specific to the unique working environment of indoor farms.
   * **Fair Wages:** Establish clear wage standards for indoor farming that reflect the skills and responsibilities involved.

**Conclusion:**

While the Farm Workforce Modernization Act primarily targets traditional agriculture, its provisions for a more stable workforce and its framework for H-2A reform could indirectly benefit the growing indoor farming sector. However, to fully realize the potential of indoor farming to enhance self-reliance, strengthen local food systems, and promote competition, future legislation should explicitly address the unique needs of this industry. By building on the principles of H.R. 4319 and tailoring them to indoor farming, policymakers can create a comprehensive approach that supports both economic growth and the well-being of all workers. The core principles of fair wages, worker protections, and a balanced approach to immigration remain essential, regardless of the specific agricultural sector being considered.",Strict-Marsupial6141,congress,1734717020.0,2,9,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1hipel3/connecting_indoor_farming_benefits_to_the_farm/,['H.R. 4319'],reddit_improved
1jbdauv,"H.R. 1968, CR: Bill is pending, on Quorum Call","**Review:**

Based on our comprehensive review, the final assessment for H.R. 1968, the CR, is a **cautious thumbs up**, primarily due to the increased Social Security funding and the lack of direct cuts to either Social Security or Medicaid benefits.

It also includes several positive provisions for healthcare access. Also, the delay of Medicaid DSH cuts as another positive aspect. The bill also continues support for Community Health Centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers, vital for underserved communities.

However, concerns remain regarding Medicare provider payment reductions.

Medicare Sequestration Increase: The bill includes a temporary increase to 4% in the Medicare sequestration for the second half of FY2025, reducing provider payments. However, other provisions, such as the extension of telehealth flexibilities, may help to mitigate potential access issues. The long-term impact will depend on whether this becomes a recurring policy.

The ""cautious"" aspect of our assessment reflects the potential negative consequences of the sequestration increase, even if those are expected to be moderate in the short term. The bill avoids a government shutdown and maintains crucial healthcare access by delaying multi-billion dollar Medicaid cuts to hospitals, extending vital Medicare telehealth flexibilities, and funding key public health programs, as well as maintaining existing entitlement programs.  If rescissions target wasteful spending *within* healthcare (though this specific bill's rescissions don't directly do that), or if they free up funds that are then used for healthcare reforms aimed at lowering costs, there could be a positive impact.

That being said, the national debt is a significant issue with far-reaching implications, including national security concerns related to the burden of interest payments. 

Status:

Bill is pending, on Quorum Call - 3/14/2025 Afternoon (DC time): If there are significant efforts to halt or negotiate the 4% sequestration increase, aiming for a compromise in the range of 2% to 3% for that period would be a logical goal for those seeking to mitigate the impact on providers. It's a common outcome in legislative negotiations to seek a middle ground.

Currently:

* This section of House Amendment 8 clearly states that no funds made available through this Act can be used by the United States DOGE Service, its temporary organization, or any detailees working for them at other agencies. This effectively prohibits the use of congressional appropriations provided in this bill for the operations or activities of the DOGE Service and its related entities.
* The DOGE Service, which evolved from the U.S. Digital Service, focuses on modernizing federal technology and improving efficiency. This amendment doesn't seem to address privacy concerns directly, but appears more focused on financial oversight (than privacy issues.)

None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to involuntarily relocate, reclassify, or remove any Federal employee who is a veteran.

* Thumbs Up (Generally):  a relatively straightforward provision aimed at protecting the jobs of veterans in the federal workforce. It's likely to be viewed favorably by many lawmakers and is unlikely to be a major point of contention. It aligns with the general principle of supporting veterans.
   * Likely Bipartisan Support: Protecting veterans is generally a popular and bipartisan issue.
* Caveat: The potential arguments against (limiting agency flexibility, potential for abuse) are worth acknowledging, but they are unlikely to outweigh the political appeal of protecting veteran employment.

* This amendment is a general provision that aims to provide some protection for federal employees and increase congressional oversight of agency restructuring. It's more likely to be germane. It would restrict the ability of agencies to involuntarily relocate, reclassify, or remove veteran employees within this group, at least within the 30-day period and without a restructuring plan submitted to Congress. Protecting federal jobs could attract some bipartisan support, although the level of support would likely depend on the specific context and the perceived need for workforce reductions.
* This does have negotiable aspects though it is legal for Executive branch to appoint in departments. The ""1 percent of employees"" threshold in Section (a) is a specific number that could be debated. The 30-Day Period: The length of the initial moratorium on large-scale layoffs (30 days) is another negotiable point. It could be shortened or lengthened. : The amendment doesn't specify what happens after the plan is submitted. Does Congress have to approve it? Can Congress modify it? Career civil servants have significant job protections under federal law. They can generally only be fired ""for cause"" (e.g., poor performance, misconduct) and have due process rights. The Executive Branch does have influence over the composition of the federal workforce, particularly at higher levels, but this amendment is focused on preventing involuntary actions against a specific protected group (veterans) within the career civil service. 
* If the *primary goal* is to fundamentally change the legal standards for removing federal employees (e.g., to make it *easier or more difficult* to fire employees for performance reasons), then a *separate bill* directly amending the relevant civil service laws would be the more appropriate and transparent approach.
   * The clearest way to change the ""for cause"" standard is for Congress to pass a new law (or amend existing laws) that explicitly modifies the rules for removing federal employees.
   * This would likely involve amending Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which governs the civil service.
      * The law would need to be very specific about what constitutes ""cause"" for removal. Vague language could lead to abuse and legal challenges.

* ""Kick the can down"" CR.
   * Murray amendment is a *major procedural move* that completely changes the substance of H.R. 1968. It's not just a modification; it's a replacement. It postpones the major funding and policy battles until later in the spring. It avoids an immediate shutdown but sets up another funding cliff in a few weeks. The amendment largely continues funding at the FY2024 levels, with *very few* specific exceptions. This is a ""cleaner"" CR than the original H.R. 1968, meaning it has fewer policy changes and targeted funding adjustments.

This allows D.C. to spend its local funds according to its own budget. This is generally a pro-home rule provision. Section 1609(a): Thumbs Up (from a D.C. autonomy perspective). The first part (1609(a)) is a generally positive, non-controversial provision supporting D.C. home rule. The second part (1609(b)) extends a highly controversial and long-standing policy rider restricting the use of local D.C. funds for abortions, though maintaining status quo.

* **Pro-D.C. Autonomy:** This provision is generally seen as *positive* for D.C. self-governance. It allows the District to manage its own local funds without being constrained by potentially outdated federal appropriations.
* **No Direct Federal Cost:** It doesn't authorize any *new* federal spending. It simply allows D.C. to spend its *own* money.
* **Likely Non-Controversial:** This type of provision is often included in appropriations bills and CRs and is usually not a major point of contention.

* This amendment proposes specific funding levels for several accounts within the ""Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs"" section of the appropriations bill (Division F of Public Law 118-47, which is the FY2024 base for the CR). It's essentially overriding the general ""continue at FY2024 levels"" rule of the CR for these specific accounts.
* The amendment is likely more of a statement of Senator Paul's strong belief in limited government spending and his opposition to many foreign assistance programs. It's a way to put his views on the record, even if he knows the amendment has no chance of passing.

1. 8. [H.Amdt.8](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119th-congress/house-amendment/8?s=a&amp;r=8) — 119th Congress (2025-2026)**Description:** Pursuant to the provisions of H.

Remember, The *real* work of crafting and amending bills usually happens in committees and through behind-the-scenes negotiations. If not, most likely non-starters, are amendments that haven't gone through this process of committee consideration or negotiation (often face a much steeper uphill battle). 

What does this mean? Lack of committee influence on amendments can sometimes lead to proposals that are not well-integrated with the existing bill, have unintended consequences, or haven't been properly evaluated for their budgetary or policy implications.

**In summary:** H.R. 1968, as analyzed, is primarily focused on its core function: providing funding for the government.

(hr 162),"The **First Amendment Accountability Act (H.R. 162)** just dropped, and it lets you sue federal employees for violating your First Amendment rights. It can be quite alarming if I do say so....

* You can take federal employees to court if they violate your rights.
* Covers free speech, religion, press, assembly, etc.
* Courts can even award attorney’s fees if you win.

This feels like a way to attack federal workers and it is an entirely red republican bill with no backing from the left. Moreover, it has been modified recently after being introduced a month ago....

1gsr6e7,Action Required 🚨🚨,"I hope you’re all doing well in light of recent horrors. I wanted to take a moment to talk about something really important that’s coming up next week: H.R. 9495. After failing to pass last week, it’s back for another vote in the House of Representatives, and we need to act!

This bill poses a serious threat to free speech and could allow the government to shut down nonprofits, news outlets, and even universities that dare to dissent. Abby Maxman from Oxfam America put it perfectly when she said it could silence critics and punish organizations that speak truth to power. That’s not just a problem for those organizations; it affects all of us.

Here’s what we can do together:
	1.	Contact Your Representatives: Let them know we oppose this bill! A quick call or email can make a huge difference.
	2.	Spread the Word: Share this post or talk about it with friends and family. The more people know, the stronger our voice will be!

Find your Reps Here: https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member

The Bill: https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241111/H9495_SUS_xml.pdf

Example Letter: 

Dear Representative,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act. This bill poses a significant threat to the fundamental principles of democracy and free speech in our nation.

H.R. 9495 would grant the Treasury Department unprecedented and unchecked power to designate nonprofits as “terrorist-supporting organizations” without proper oversight or due process. This sweeping authority could be easily abused to target organizations based on political motivations rather than legitimate security concerns.

The bill’s vague language and broad scope create a chilling effect on civil society. Nonprofits advocating for crucial issues like human rights, environmental protection, and reproductive rights could face the loss of their tax-exempt status simply for expressing views that oppose certain political agendas.
Furthermore, this legislation could severely impact the ability of organizations to function, potentially leading to financial ruin for those who dare to stand up for our basic rights and freedoms. The mere threat of such action could intimidate nonprofits into self-censorship, stifling important advocacy work.

I urge you to vote NO on H.R. 9495. Our democracy depends on a vibrant civil society that can operate without fear of arbitrary government retaliation. Let’s not provide tools that could be used to suppress dissent and silence critical voices in our society.

Thank you for your consideration of this crucial matter.

1jp9yx3,Megathread: Senator Cory Booker Sets All-Time US Senate Speech Length Record in Protest Against Trump Administration,"Today, at 7:19 p.m. US Eastern time, Senator Cory Booker set the all-time record for a marathon speech protesting many different aspects of the second Trump administration.  The speech's formal status as a filibuster is debatable because, [as NPR noted](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/01/nx-s1-5347318/cory-booker-senate-speech), ""that's not technically what Booker's speech is, since he is not trying to block a specific bill or nominee"".  The senior senator from New Jersey has so far yielded to multiple questions from Senate colleagues over the course of the speech.

You can read more about filibusters [here on the US Senate's site](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm).  You can find this subreddit's [live discussion thread on the speech here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1johsh3/discussion_thread_us_senate_filibuster_on_march/).  You can watch the speech [here on PBS NewsHour's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tQnm19ZTD0), and find other information about it on [the Wikipedia page for the speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker's_marathon_speech), which is still ongoing at the time of posting.

The previous Senate speech length record was held by [Strom Thurmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond), at the time a Democrat from the state of South Carolina, attempting to block or delay passage of the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957).

1nux3ih,Thoughts on Shutdown,"- The Republican “clean CR” received 55 votes with only one Republican (Rand Paul) voting against it, while the Democratic bill seeking to permanently extend ACA subsidies and restore nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts received even fewer votes
- Since the Senate requires 60 votes to pass funding legislation, even unanimous Republican support at 51 votes wouldn’t be sufficient, meaning bipartisan cooperation is mathematically necessary
- The Republican bill was significantly closer to the 60-vote threshold, requiring only 5 Democrats to compromise rather than Republicans having to make up a much larger deficit for the Democratic proposal
- The Republican bill maintains current spending levels without cuts to existing programs, while the Democratic additions represent new or restored spending for long-term policy changes
- Republicans argue these major healthcare debates shouldn’t be jammed into a last-minute funding bill
- Two Democratic senators (Fetterman and Cortez Masto) broke ranks to support the Republican measure, demonstrating some Democrats recognized the need to prioritize keeping the government open
- From a purely practical standpoint, the responsibility to bridge the gap and prevent a shutdown falls more heavily on Democrats​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Sure-Two-5672,Conservative,1759287511.0,23,24,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1nux3ih/thoughts_on_shutdown/,[],reddit_improved

1ki2ck9,Biden's border act of 2024,"The border bill wouldn't have fixed things. The Hill shows that in the article below. The Hill is part of Newsnation, which is an independent party news channel. All the border bill would have done is cap the number of new illegal immigrants to a few million. The bill also would have expired after three years. And the president had the abilities to modify and essentially override the bill. 

Newsnation said Biden only deported about 300,000 illegal immigrants, out of the 9-11 million that came.

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4361](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4361)

Next is what Bill Whitaker told Kamala Harris about the border crisis. If Biden and Harris did not loosen the immigration policies (and create the border crisis) then why did Bill Whitaker ask Kamala Harris if it was a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as she did? Why would Bill Whitaker and 60 Minutes lie about Harris loosening the immigration policies and creating the border crisis? 60 Minutes is from CBS, which is one of the most liberal news channels and is against Trump. CBS edited Kamala Harris' interview to make her look better. They cut one of her real answers and put in a completely new one because the first was word salad.

1ioj9ur,"Mann, Moran sponsor bills to secure safe harbor for Food for Peace program at USDA • Kansas Reflector","Moran and Mann, along with several Republican colleagues in Congress, introduced bills in the Senate and House to provide a safe harbor for Food for Peace. The program has been relied on to combat hunger for 70 years by feeding 4 billion people in more than 150 countries.

Moran said food aid had proven its value in fostering political stability abroad, bolstering U.S. national security and providing markets for U.S. crops.

“As part of an ongoing effort to save money and increase efficiency, Food for Peace should be moved to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” Moran said. “By moving this program closer to the producers who grow these crops, we can help reduce waste and make certain our farmers have access to this valuable market.”

I feel like for the most part since I started tracking the house/senate (about 2 weeks ago) 90% of the bills have been fairly cut and dry for me about how I feel about them, but after reading multiple opinions about this bipartisan bill, I realize that it feels very much like a non partisan issue. I was wondering what the pros and cons of it? I’m planning on watching the proceeding to learn more about it while the bill is being talked about.

# Passed House (11/12/2024)

Sponsor: [Rep. Graves, Garret \[R-LA-6\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/garret-graves/G000577)

Committees: House - Ways and Means

Latest Action: Senate - 12/12/2024 Cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the measure presented in Senate.

This bill repeals provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who receive other benefits, such as a pension from a state or local government.

The bill eliminates the government pension offset, which in various instances reduces Social Security benefits for spouses, widows, and widowers who also receive government pensions of their own.

The bill also eliminates the windfall elimination provision, which in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.

These changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.

  
My take: I think this is a good way to conserve Social Security spending.

  
2. **Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act** 

**Sponsor:** [Rep. Tenney, Claudia \[R-NY-24\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/claudia-tenney/T000478) 

**Committees:** House - Ways and Means

# Passed House (11/21/2024)

**Latest Action:** Senate - 12/02/2024 Received in the Senate.

This bill postpones certain tax filing deadlines for U.S. nationals who are unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad or held hostage abroad and their spouses. It also allows for a refund and abatement of tax penalties and fines paid by hostages, detained individuals, and their spouses or dependents. 

The bill terminates the tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations.  

My take: Why were terrorist supporting organizations given tax-exempt status?

3. No Kings Act

Sponsor: [Sen. Schumer, Charles E. \[D-NY\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/charles-schumer/S000148)

# Placed on Calendar Senate (09/09/2024)

Latest Action: Senate - 09/09/2024 Read the second time. Placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.

To reassert the constitutional authority of Congress to determine the general applicability of the criminal laws of the United States, and for other purposes.

My take: I absolutely love this. Constitutionally granted Congressional authority should not be challenged

4. **Social Security Fairness Act**

# Introduced in Senate (03/01/2023)

Sponsor: [Sen. Brown, Sherrod \[D-OH\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/sherrod-brown/B000944) 

Committees: Senate - Finance

Latest Action: Senate - 03/01/2023 Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.

This bill repeals provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who receive other benefits, such as a pension from a state or local government.

The bill eliminates the *government pension offset*, which in various instances reduces Social Security benefits for spouses, widows, and widowers who also receive government pensions of their own.

The bill also eliminates the *windfall elimination provision*, which in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.

These changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.

My take: This provides context for the number 1 most viewed lol

5. **Border Act of 2024**

**Sponsor:** [Sen. Murphy, Christopher \[D-CT\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/christopher-murphy/M001169) 

# Introduced in Senate (05/16/2024)

Latest Action: Senate - 05/23/2024 Cloture on the motion to proceed to the measure not invoked in Senate by Yea-Nay Vote. 43 - 50.

The bill expands Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority to address the processing of non-U.S. nationals (*aliens* under federal law) and provides supplemental appropriations for related purposes.  
  
Among other provisions, the bill provides DHS emergency authority to summarily remove or prohibit the entry of certain non-U.S. nationals within 100 miles of the southwest land border. DHS may exercise this authority if DHS encounters an average of 4,000 non-U.S. nationals within a seven-day period. If the number of encounters reach certain higher thresholds, DHS must exercise the emergency authority. This emergency border authority expires after three years and may be modified by the President under specified circumstances.

Next, the bill establishes an expedited process that authorizes asylum officers to adjudicate certain asylum claims. Among other provisions, these *provisional noncustodial removal proceedings* impose certain target timelines for determining asylum claims and limit review of denied claims. The bill also establishes a stricter threshold for individuals to remain in the United States pending adjudication of an asylum petition.

The bill extends and establishes immigration pathways for Afghan citizens or nationals, including by (1) making certain individuals admitted or paroled to the United States eligible for conditional permanent resident status, and (2) expanding eligibility for special immigrant visas for certain individuals who were injured while supporting the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.

The bill also increases base pay for asylum officers and grants DHS temporary direct hire authority to hire personnel to implement the bill.

My take: My main issue with this is the powers granted to DHS. Three years seems way too long to have emergency powers over the border. Also, I think the borders should be more open, and we should stop deporting people.

6. **Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act of 2024 or the BITCOIN Act of 2024**

**Sponsor:** [Sen. Lummis, Cynthia M. \[R-WY\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/cynthia-lummis/L000571) 

# Introduced in Senate (07/31/2024)

**Committees:** Senate - Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

**Latest Action:** Senate - 07/31/2024 Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

This bill provides for the acquisition and storage of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin by the U.S. government.

The Department of the Treasury must purchase one million Bitcoins over a five-year period and hold the Bitcoins in trust for the United States. All Bitcoins acquired under this bill must be held for at least 20 years unless used to retire outstanding federal debt.

The bill directs Treasury to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the secure storage of U.S. Bitcoins. The reserve must be a decentralized network of secure facilities across the United States. Existing U.S. Bitcoin holdings must be transferred to the reserve. States may voluntarily store Bitcoin holdings in the reserve in segregated accounts.

The bill also reduces the total amount of U.S. dollars Federal Reserve banks may hold in surplus and requires Federal Reserve banks to remit a certain amount of net earnings annually to the purchase of Bitcoins.

My take: This is dumb. We would just be creating a new gold standard but with crypto

7. **Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2021**

**Sponsor:** [Sen. Carper, Thomas R. \[D-DE\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/thomas-carper/C000174)

# Introduced in Senate (03/04/2021)

Committees: Senate - Finance

**Latest Action:** Senate - 03/04/2021 Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.

This bill expands Medicare coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity. Specifically, the bill allows coverage for therapy that is provided by (1) a physician who is not a primary care physician; or (2) other health care providers (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and approved counseling programs, if provided upon a referral from, and in coordination with, a physician or primary care practitioner. Currently, such therapy is covered only if provided by a primary care practitioner.

The bill also allows coverage under Medicare's prescription drug benefit of drugs used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss management for individuals who are overweight.

My take: I would support this, and I think the processed food industry should shoulder the medical costs, similar to the tobacco industry. Unfortunately, it appears to have been forgotten

8. **Kidney Patient Access to Technologically Innovative and Essential Nephrology Treatments Act of 2023 or the Kidney PATIENT Act of 2023**

**Sponsor:** [Rep. Carter, Earl L. ""Buddy"" \[R-GA-1\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/earl-carter/C001103) 

# Introduced in House (07/28/2023)

**Committees:** House - Energy and Commerce; Ways and Means

Latest Action: House - 06/11/2024 Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Ways and Means.

This bill delays a change to the payment methodology under Medicare for oral drugs that are used to treat end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Under current regulations, beginning January 1, 2025, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services will incorporate payments for oral-only ESRD drugs into the ESRD prospective payment system rather than issuing separate payments to ESRD facilities. The bill delays implementation of this policy until January 1, 2033, or until an approved intravenous drug is available, whichever is earlier.

My take: Not really sure what's going on here

**9. Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2023 or the SAFE Banking Act of 2023**

**Sponsor: S**[en. Merkley, Jeff \[D-OR\]](https://www.congress.gov/member/jeff-merkley/M001176)

# Introduced in Senate (04/26/2023)

Committees: Senate - Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

Latest Action: Senate - 05/11/2023 Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Hearings held.

This bill provides protections for federally regulated financial institutions that serve state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. Currently, many financial institutions do not provide services to state-sanctioned marijuana businesses due to the federal classification of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance.

Under the bill, a federal banking regulator may not penalize a depository institution for providing banking services to a state-sanctioned marijuana business. For example, regulators may not terminate or limit the deposit or share insurance of a depository institution solely because the institution provides financial services to a state-sanctioned marijuana business.

The bill also prohibits a federal banking regulator from requesting or ordering a depository institution to terminate a customer account unless (1) the regulator has determined that the depository institution is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice or is violating a law or regulation, and (2) that determination is not based primarily on reputation risk.

Additionally, proceeds from a transaction involving activities of a state-sanctioned marijuana business are no longer considered proceeds from unlawful activity. (Financial institutions that handle proceeds from unlawful activity are subject to anti-money laundering laws. Violators of these laws are subject to fines and imprisonment.)

Furthermore, a financial institution, insurer, or federal agency may not be held liable or subject to asset forfeiture under federal law for providing a loan, mortgage, or other financial service to a state-sanctioned marijuana business.

My take: In order to properly account and tax marijuana sales, we should give them access to the banks. I think this bill is a great idea, but I do not think it will pass.

1hfsc0b,The House is considering legislation to bar members of Congress from collecting their pensions if they are convicted of felonies related to their official duties. ,"This measure aims to increase accountability and deter corruption among elected officials.

**Potential Benefits:**

* Increased accountability and deterrence of corruption.
* Restoration of public trust in government.
* Reinforcement of ethical standards.
* Potential financial savings for taxpayers.
* Alignment with standards in other professions.
* Reduced incentive for plea deals.
* Discouraging abuse of power.
* Promoting public service as a duty.
* Strengthening the rule of law.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

* Due process concerns.
* Ex post facto concerns.
* Definition of ""felony"" and ""related to official duties.""
* Impact on families.
* Effectiveness as a deterrent.
* Potential for political targeting.

**The Right to an Attorney:**

* The right to an attorney is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.
* This right applies to everyone, including members of Congress.
* It ensures a fair legal process before any penalties, including pension forfeiture.
* Includes the right to choose counsel, the right to effective assistance, and the right to representation during appeals.

**In Summary:**

The proposed legislation seeks to hold members of Congress accountable for criminal conduct by barring them from collecting their pensions. While this measure has the potential to deter corruption and restore public trust, it also raises important legal and practical considerations. The right to an attorney is crucial to ensuring that any such penalties are imposed fairly and justly.

# [https://www.c-span.org/event/us-house-of-representatives/us-house-of-representatives/429581](https://www.c-span.org/event/us-house-of-representatives/us-house-of-representatives/429581)

While the idea of holding members of Congress accountable for criminal behavior might seem like something everyone could agree on, the specifics of this type of legislation can easily become partisan.

Here's why this kind of bill might not be bipartisan and what that means for amendments and further exploration:

**Reasons for Potential Partisanship:**

* **Differing Views on Punishment:** Democrats and Republicans may have different philosophies on appropriate punishments for public officials who commit crimes. Some might favor harsher penalties, while others might prioritize rehabilitation or leniency in certain cases.
* **Concerns about Political Targeting:** There might be concerns that such a law could be used disproportionately against members of one party, especially in a highly polarized political environment.
* **Differing Views on the Role of Government:** There could be disagreements about the extent to which the government should intervene in matters related to individual conduct and benefits.

**Implications for Amendments and Further Exploration:**

* **Amendments to Narrow the Scope:** To gain bipartisan support, amendments might be proposed to narrow the scope of the legislation. For example:
   * **Specific Crimes:** Instead of applying to all felonies, the law could focus on specific crimes like bribery, corruption, or treason.
   * **Higher Standard of Proof:** Amendments could require a higher standard of proof for conviction before pension forfeiture is triggered.
   * **Protections Against Political Targeting:** Safeguards could be added to prevent the law from being used for political purposes.
* **Exploration of Alternative Solutions:** To achieve bipartisan consensus, lawmakers might explore alternative solutions, such as:
   * **Increased Ethics Training:** More rigorous ethics training for members of Congress could help prevent misconduct.
   * **Independent Ethics Oversight:** Strengthening independent ethics oversight bodies could increase accountability.
   * **Changes to Campaign Finance Laws:** Reforming campaign finance laws could reduce the potential for corruption.

**The Importance of Bipartisanship:**

Bipartisan support is crucial for legislation of this nature to be effective and sustainable. If the law is perceived as partisan, it could undermine public trust and lead to political battles that hinder its implementation.

Expanding he scope of scrutiny beyond just pension forfeiture to include the *eligibility* of individuals to even run for or serve in Congress in the first place, especially those with past accusations or records.

Notably, there is *no explicit mention of criminal history* as a disqualification for serving in Congress.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and potential implications:

**Current Eligibility Requirements:**

Currently, the Constitution sets very few qualifications for serving in Congress:

* **House of Representatives:**
   * At least 25 years old.
   * U.S. citizen for at least seven years.
   * Inhabitant of the state they represent.
* **Senate:**
   * At least 30 years old.
   * U.S. citizen for at least nine years.
   * Inhabitant of the state they represent.

Expanding eligibility requirements for members of Congress to include scrutiny of past accusations or records is a complex issue with significant legal and practical implications. While it might seem appealing as a way to ensure higher ethical standards, it's crucial to carefully consider the potential for abuse, the need for due process, and the potential impact on the democratic process. It would likely require a constitutional amendment to add qualifications beyond those currently listed.

1jqsfb9,SCOOP: Sen. Collins Eyes Visa Fix for Religious Workers,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has a new bill on her website aimed at addressing the immigration challenges faced by religious workers caught in lengthy visa backlogs. The [Religious Workforce Protection Act](https://www.collins.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/mdm25757.pdf) of 2025 seeks to extend nonimmigrant status and provide job flexibility for these workers as they await permanent residency.

# Origins and Progress of the Religious Visa Bill

In January, *Migrant Insider* identified a visa backlog affecting religious clergy and asked Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), about legislative plans. Hawley wrote to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the matter but has yet to receive a reply.

When asked, Sens. John Hoeven (R-ND), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND), mentioned that they supported protecting religious workers as key community assets, while Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Collins have driven the bill forward with enthusiasm. On many fronts, other senators have expressed sincere bipartisan support for religious clergy and their value to society.

Since January, the bill faced repeated delays—due to a Continuing Resolution and Sen. Cory Booker’s 25-hour filibuster, amongst other things—despite promises of an earlier release. *Migrant Insider* has now exclusively obtained the bill and shares its details and significance.

# What’s Inside the Bill

The bill, introduced in the 119th Congress, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow religious workers with pending immigrant visa applications to remain in the U.S. legally under their existing R-1 nonimmigrant status. Currently, R-1 visas, granted to ministers and other religious professionals, are limited to a maximum stay of five years. The new measure would permit extensions until their applications for lawful permanent residence are processed, bypassing this time restriction.

The legislation also introduces limited job flexibility, allowing religious workers to change employers without jeopardizing their visa applications—a provision previously restricted to certain other immigrant categories. Additionally, it exempts those who left the U.S. due to the five-year cap from a regulation requiring a one-year foreign residency before reapplying, offering a pathway for their return.

For the religious community, the implications are significant. Faith-based organizations, which often rely on international clergy and workers to fill roles in underserved areas, have long faced challenges due to visa delays. The backlog for religious worker immigrant visas, known as EB-4 special immigrant visas, has disrupted continuity in religious services, particularly in rural or minority communities.

# What Happens Now?

The bill’s passage is not guaranteed. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further review.

1jb6hix,"It would make sense for Senator Schumer to prioritize streamlining immigration courts, Pairing that with closing tax loopholes could create a powerful narrative of efficiency and fairness. Those would be monumental achievements.","It would make sense for Senator Schumer to prioritize streamlining immigration courts, given the immense backlog and its ripple effects on the entire system. Pairing that with closing tax loopholes could create a powerful narrative of efficiency and fairness—addressing systemic issues while ensuring resources are used wisely.

Those would be monumental achievements. Streamlining immigration courts addresses a critical systemic issue, while closing tax loopholes demonstrates a commitment to fairness and fiscal responsibility. Together, they’d create a legacy of efficiency, justice, and accountability—impacting millions of lives and strengthening public trust.

""streamlining immigration courts is a pressing issue, and many lawmakers recognize the need for reform.

* closing tax loopholes is a common policy proposal among Democrats, including Senator Schumer.
* Pairing these two issues could create a compelling narrative. It could frame the immigration court reforms as a matter of government efficiency and responsible resource management, while the tax loophole closures could be presented as a way to generate revenue to fund those reforms and address broader economic inequality.""

These are fairly low-hanging fruit. (not as hard as one thinks) Streamlining immigration courts and closing tax loopholes are not only achievable but also resonate deeply with both efficiency-minded and fairness-focused constituencies.

\*\*Key Existing Bills (\*\*Previous bills, but needs updating) **and Their Status:**

1. [S.3178 (118th Congress) - Immigration Court Efficiency and Children's Court Act of 2023](https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/s3178/BILLS-118s3178is.xml)
   * By Senator Michael Bennet (Dan Goldman cosponsored) would have to speak with Chuck
   * Weaknesses\*\*:\*\* Insufficient funding, lacks guaranteed legal representation, limited scope (primarily focused on court proceedings).
   * Status: Needs updating - modernizing - address funding-resources related, lacks guaranteed legal representation, limited scope - re-consensus, co-sponsor
2. [S.663 (116th Congress) - The Immigration Court Improvement Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s663/BILLS-116s663is.xml)
   * Bill aimed to enhance the effectiveness of immigration courts by clarifying their status, promoting decisional independence for immigration judges, and ensuring fair and impartial proceedings
   * Weaknesses: Similar to S.3178, and less detailed in some areas.
   * Status: Needs updating - modernizing - re-consensus, co-sponsor

A conciliated, consensus-driven update is needed, then present. Streamlining immigration courts is about fixing inefficiencies, ensuring due process, and creating a system that works better for everyone. Closing tax loopholes is about fairness and fiscal responsibility, values that resonate widely. Overall, kind of ""low-hanging fruit"", pragmatic solutions that have been simmering for years that when executed well, could leave a lasting positive impact.",Strict-Marsupial6141,congress,1741965899.0,5,1,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1jb6hix/it_would_make_sense_for_senator_schumer_to/,"['S.663', 'S.3178', 's663', 's3178']",reddit_improved

The House of Representatives passed the bill with **an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 327-75**. Now awaiting a Senate vote, the bill aims to address key issues in Social Security, particularly the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). These provisions have unfairly reduced benefits for many public service workers. By correcting these inequities, the bill seeks to improve retirement security and financial stability for affected individuals.

The Social Security Fairness Act is an update to the Social Security Act of 1935. It aims to repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which were introduced in the 1970s to address certain inequities in Social Security benefits for public sector workers.

Carper Water Resources Development Act of 2024 (WRDA 2024) is indeed ready to go.,"This biennial legislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake critical projects related to flood control, navigation, ecosystem restoration, and more. It aims to address the diverse water resource needs across the nation, benefiting all 50 states.

The final version of the bill has been agreed upon by both the House and Senate, and it includes policy and programmatic reforms to streamline Corps processes and reduce red tape. This will help get projects done faster and more efficiently.

It's a comprehensive approach to improving water infrastructure and ensuring long-term sustainability for communities nationwide.

WRDA is typically passed every two years and is a key component of the federal government's efforts to manage water resources. The legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out a wide range of projects, including:

* **Flood control:** Building levees, dams, and other structures to protect communities from flooding.
* **Navigation:** Improving and maintaining navigable waterways, like rivers and harbors, to support commercial and recreational transportation.
* **Ecosystem restoration:** Restoring and protecting wetlands, coastal areas, and other vital ecosystems.

1hra6hg,Social security fairness act,"The US Senate passed the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) over the weekend, sending the bill that will expand Social Security benefits to millions of public-sector employees to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature.

The bill reverses the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO), two policies that significantly decrease the amount of money received from Social Security by public employees who also earned a municipal pension.

The WEP reduces benefits for retired or disabled workers who have fewer than 30 years of significant earnings from employment covered by Social Security if they also receive pensions on the basis of noncovered employment. The GPO reduces the spousal or surviving spousal benefits of people who receive pensions on the basis of noncovered employment.

The laws have been on the books for decades impacting the retirement earnings of police officers, teachers, firefighters, and other public sector employees.

The Senate passed the SSFA on a 76-20 vote, with Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy joining a bipartisan coalition of supporters. This follows last month’s House passage of the bill by an overwhelming bipartisan margin of 327 to 75. The bill now heads to President Biden, who is expected to sign it into law.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, celebrated the bill’s passage.
Today, justice was finally done for the millions of American workers who dedicated their lives to serving the public but had their retirements throttled by a punitive and unnecessary loophole. The Senate joined the House and delivered on its promise to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so that every public employee can retire with dignity and grace,” Weingarten said in a statement. “This bill had wide bipartisan support from lawmakers and their constituents for one simple reason: It’s about basic fairness. President Biden, from the start of his administration, has acted decisively on retirement security and we hope he will sign the bill quickly.”

Weingarten said everyone knows a teacher, firefighter, police officer, nurse, or public worker of some kind who has paid into Social Security year after year, only to have their payments curbed by the WEP and GPO when they retire.",ExpensivePatience457,congress,1735759270.0,1,1,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1hra6hg/social_security_fairness_act/,[],reddit_improved

The Counter UAS Act is a bipartisan bill that was introduced by Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) in the Senate, and by Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Representative Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) in the House of Representatives.  
  
The law aims to provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies with the authorities and resources needed to effectively counter the threat of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), also known as drones.  
  
Some of the key provisions of the Counter UAS Act include:  
  
\* Authorizing the DoD to develop and deploy counter-UAS systems to protect military personnel and installations  
\* Providing the DoD with the authority to conduct research and development on counter-UAS technologies  
\* Requiring the DoD to develop a comprehensive strategy for countering UAS threats  
\* Authorizing the DoD to work with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration, to counter UAS threats  
\* Providing funding for the development and deployment of counter-UAS systems  
  
The Counter UAS Act also includes provisions related to the protection of critical infrastructure, such as airports and seaports, from UAS threats.

**On the surface, it seems straightforward:**

* **Automatic CR Trigger:** If a regular appropriations bill isn't passed by the start of the fiscal year, an automatic continuing resolution kicks in.
* **Funding Levels:** The CR funds the government at 99% of the previous year's levels, with a 1% reduction every 90 days. This declining funding is intended to incentivize Congress to pass a real budget.
* **Existing Terms and Conditions:** The CR maintains the same terms and conditions as the previous year's funding.

**Fine tuning:**

* a smaller reduction rate, like 0.5%, might be more appropriate to minimize disruption and allow for a more sustainable automatic CR.
* **""Current Law"" Definition:** Clarifying the definition of ""current law"" would help avoid ambiguities and potential legal challenges.
* **Exceptions:** Providing clearer guidelines on the application of exceptions would ensure they are used appropriately and prevent unintended consequences.

**Strengths of S. 299:**

* **Addresses a Critical Issue:** It directly tackles the problem of government shutdowns, which can have severe consequences for the economy, public services, and government employees.
* **Provides a Safety Net:** The automatic CR mechanism acts as a safety net, ensuring that essential government functions continue even if Congress fails to pass a budget on time.
* **Incentivizes Action:** The declining funding provision aims to encourage lawmakers to reach a budget agreement rather than relying on perpetual continuing resolutions.",Strict-Marsupial6141,congress,1734673346.0,1,0,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1hid2mb/s_299_has_the_potential_to_be_a_valuable_tool_in/,"['S. 299', 'S.299']",reddit_improved

1mmj82q,Found wife's reddit account. Getting a divorce.,"Am I the Asshole?

Trigger warnings: abuse, facism, hatred, gaslighting, MAGA, literally Hitler, pedophilia, death camps, Russian agents 

My wife has been acting weird lately. I have always been able to read off her phone but lately she has been hiding it. I was very worried she was talking to another guy and/or having an affair. 

Yesterday she was using her phone and put it down, went into the bathroom and started to shower. I realized she forgot her phone as lately she would basically hide it when showering. 

I went through her messages, contacts, calls, etc, and found nothing. No unusual pics, calls or emails. Then I started looking through her apps and saw reddit. She has never mentioned it before. I was terrified she was having an affair but what I found was so much worse.

Her reddit account has hundreds of posts and they are all on r/Conservative! She defends Trump and Republicans! How could she! I can't believe I am married to a nazi. I was heart broken. I was literally shaking! She knows our neighbors and uncles who voted Trumpf all regret it now! I cut off all contact with them but I am sure they regret it!

There was not a single hate post or pedo accusation against Trump. Not one. Not a single post exposing Stephen Miller for being Satan. In fact she was defending them! She didn't even call out Fallon for having Gutfeld on! All her posts were like, ""Trump is doing a good job here but could be better if...""

WTF! How can she humanize Drumpf??!! Orange man is actually worse than Hitler, how could she!! I feel victimized by this betrayal. One post said the Sidney Sweeney ad ""wasn't even a big deal""! Another post claimed we were ""on the right track"" regarding tariffs when we are certainly heading towards a great depression. This has caused me so much anxiety and mental anguish. She said it wasn't ok to attack federal law enforcement who we all know are terrorist agents of the orange man who is sending people to death camps!!!

I packed up my stuff, took our kids and am staying at my mom's. I can't be in the same house as a nazi and my neodivergent, gender fluid 2 year old twins have been very sad about mommy being a racist pedo supporter and Russian agent. 

Am I the asshole? Planning on divorcing her. She has a job and pays all the bills. I stay at home raising the twins and use my free time to anger smash the downvote button on all r/Conservative posts. It's an honest days work.

1l39ff7,[Stephen Miller] Some critics are confusing the extension of tax cuts as increasing the deficit. Attacking the deficit impact of the BBB is attacking a tax cut,"https://x.com/stephenm/status/1930242667025195048

One of the bigger points of confusion on the BBB is spending vs tax cuts.

The lefty CBO says extending the 2017 tax cuts (preventing their expiration) increases the deficit.

Some critics have seen this figure and claimed or implied the bill increases *spending.*

Even according to CBO, the bill cuts spending over $1.6 trillion.

So when a libertarian (eg Rand) attacks the “deficit” impact of the bill they are attacking the tax cut.

Of course, honestly accounted, extending current tax rates has zero deficit impact which is why the bill, because of its spending cuts, reduces the deficit.

A second major point of confusion is what’s actually in a reconciliation bill. It is not an appropriations bill, or a general budget bill. It provides no funding or authorization for 99%+ of the operations of government. It was written not by appropriators but some of the most conservative members of the House.

1i7p41r,What are the pros and cons of mandating firearm safety education in public schools?,"About a year ago, Tennessee proposed [adding firearm safety courses to public schools](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/20/tennessee-house-to-vote-on-age-appropriate-gun-safety-training-bill-for-students/72673401007/) in the state, a practice that [used to be somewhat common](https://time.com/3688072/portraits-of-schoolkids-learning-firearm-safety-in-rural-indiana-1956/) across the US.

What are the pros and cons of such a policy? Does firearm safety education actually reduce gun violence or does it have the opposite effect? Is there evidence that more or less familiarity with firearms results in a public benefit?

This seems really scary right? This is what AI gives me as a recap. 

The FairTax Act of 2025 aims to replace existing federal taxes, such as income tax, payroll taxes, estate and gift taxes, with a national sales tax that is primarily administered by individual states. 



The proposed national sales tax would be a broad-based tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption, similar to the sales and use taxes currently in place in 45 states. 



The bill also proposes abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and phasing out the administration of repealed federal taxes by the end of fiscal year 2029. 



The sunset provision in the bill states that if the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution is not repealed within seven years of the bill’s enactment, the provisions and amendments made by the bill would be void",wallanut,congress,1739085884.0,2,20,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1il9eej/can_anyone_who_has_looked_at_bills_tell_me/,[],reddit_improved
1kmu66d,Would Congress function better with 50% fewer representatives?,"I’ve had this question on my mind for quite some time now. I want to see what a larger number of people think.

My theory behind the question is that there are too many characters to keep track of, and too many special interests to account for in legal negotiation. Not only is it hard for the media to keep tabs on congresspeople (short of a particular national scandal), but it’s hard for Congress to pass bills and hard for representatives to behave independently of party interest. If we doubled the population each representative represented, they would necessarily have more voters from the opposite party. It would also be harder to gerrymander the districts.

The goal here is to make Congress ACTUALLY efficient and effective, so that the institution as a whole can carry out its duties in a timely manner. We all know this goal needs to be achieved, otherwise we will continue to have legislature by executive order whether the president is Trump or Obama. I’m tired of our expectation of Congress to be that they pass 1 or 2 massive bills per year, when they should be passing bills nearly all the time. 

Would this idea help or hurt? If it would help, can someone close to power please steal my idea? I don’t care about credit, I just want to see half of these clowns lose their jobs so that we can keep the ones worth keeping and not have a circus of people scrambling desperately for media attention. 

Some notes:
- If the house decreases by 50% by doubling district population count by 2x, I do not want this to change the numbers in the electoral college.
- States still cannot have fewer than 1 rep, so I acknowledge that they would increase in proportional representation… to me it seems a small price. This is why I don’t want to touch the EC numbers with this idea. 

TL;DR - Double the population of each congressional district, forcing states to redraw them, thereby cutting the number of seats / districts in half to make it more efficient. Good idea or bad idea?",Ol_Meadster,congress,1747266487.0,0,3,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1kmu66d/would_congress_function_better_with_50_fewer/,[],reddit_improved
1hrcryz,Blumenthal Anticipates Signing of Social Security Fairness Act ‘Within Days,"US Sen. Richard Blumenthal revealed on Monday morning that President Biden had “assured” him he would sign the Social Security Fairness Act, bringing to a conclusion a fight that public sector employees have been engaged in for decades. 

“I know folks out there are hearing, oh, they repealed the windfall elimination provision. So our public service workers are getting a windfall now. Trust me, believe these folks. There is no windfall here,” Blumenthal said at a news conference Monday with representatives from public sector labor unions.

Blumenthal was referring to the repeal of the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). These laws, passed decades ago, prevented municipal public sector employees who qualified for a pension from receiving their full Social Security benefits, and from receiving death benefits if their spouse passed away.

“They paid into Social Security just like everyone else,” he said. “They deserve to be paid by Social Security, just like everyone else, without an offset, a penalty, just because they did public service work … Everybody ought to be treated equally. They’ve earned it. They’ve paid into it. There’s no windfall for anyone here. And I’ve been assured by the White House that the President will be signing this measure literally within days.”

Passage of the Social Security Fairness Act will impact more than 32,000 Connecticut residents, and more than 3 million people across the nation. Retirees will be eligible to receive up to an additional $600 in Social Security benefits, calculated retroactively to 2024. The bill had broad bipartisan support, with a majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress voting yes.

Mary Moninger-Elia, an organizer with the American Federation of Teachers Connecticut, described her own experiences with being denied benefits due to the WEP/GPO.

“[Repealing WEP/GPO] became personal for me at some point when I retired, and I applied for my benefits, and they said, you’re not getting $400 a month of your earned benefits because of the WEP,” she said. “And then it became more devastatingly personal two years ago when my husband died, and though he had paid him Social Security for over 40 years, his wife got nothing. All the money he had put into Social Security was now going to pay other people’s spouses for their survivor benefits, but his spouse got nothing. That just seemed more than I could stand, or more than seemed necessary to happen.”

Moninger-Elia credited their success to forming a coalition of many public sector employees that crossed political and ideological lines and had support around the country to put pressure on legislators everywhere to support repeal.

“I believe, having worked on this for so many years before that, that getting people out of their silos helped. All of us had worked on it in our own little silos,” Moninger-Elia said. “[Betty Marafino, president of the Connecticut Alliance for Retired Americans] helped bring us out of those silos to work together. We started doing what we called the Hollywood Squares on Zoom meetings, where we would see one another, so we got to know one another that way, and we planned the strategies.“

Blumenthal ended by reiterating that public sector employees had earned the money they were receiving.

“We ought to be saying thank you to our public service workers, thank you to our firefighters, thank you to our police and our teachers who are in the classrooms day in and day out, year after year,” he said. “We’re righting a 50-year-old wrong here.”

A [2024 Monmouth poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_022624/) found that 61% of Americans view illegal immigration as a very serious problem.

A [2024 PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/where-voters-stand-on-immigration) found that 42% of Americans feel that if the U.S. is too open, it risks losing its national identity.

Satisfactory immigration reform can be achieved by focusing on 1) border security and 2) legal immigration pathways.

President Trump and Republicans in Congress should work with vulnerable Democratic senators (e.g. Ossoff,D-Georgia) to:

1) enhance measures to prevent illegal entry by building physical barriers, increasing patrols, and using technology for surveillance 

2) raise the standards for asylum eligibility and obtaining visas, green cards, and citizenship, including family-based and employment-based immigration.",najumobi,Conservative,1731355292.0,16,3,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gp1knn/president_trump_and_republicans_in_congress/,[],reddit_improved

Trump and Doge decide they are going to go ahead and fix this problem anyway. Of course, interest groups who depend on the endless free money glitch take Trump to court. But, there are many, many different kinds of appropriations- worded in many different ways. Now, judges will have to determine which spending continues.

1ig9xvf,Declaration of Independence,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",democracyatallcosts,Conservative,1738536147.0,11,1,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ig9xvf/declaration_of_independence/,[],reddit_improved

1h1p51e,Congress has the constitutional power to regulate foreign commerce and enact laws that establish tariff rates and may be involved in the process of setting and adjusting tariffs. ,"Congress may be involved in the process of setting and adjusting tariffs. In the United States, Congress has the authority to regulate foreign commerce and impose tariffs on imported goods.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to ""regulate Commerce with foreign Nations"" (Article I, Section 8), which includes the authority to impose tariffs. Congress can pass laws that establish tariff rates, and the President can sign these laws into effect.

**Legislative Authority:** Congress has the constitutional power to regulate foreign commerce and enact laws that establish tariff rates. This includes authorizing the President to negotiate trade agreements and modify tariffs under certain conditions.

In practice, the process of setting tariffs often involves a combination of Congressional action and executive branch decision-making. For example:

\* Congress may pass a law that authorizes the President to impose tariffs on certain goods or countries.

\* The President may then use this authority to impose tariffs, often in consultation with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and other executive branch officials.

\* Congress may also hold hearings and conduct oversight to ensure that the tariffs are being imposed in a fair and transparent manner.

In the case of the USMCA and US-China trade agreements, Congress played a role in approving these agreements and setting the tariff rates. However, the specifics of tariff rates and trade policies are often negotiated by the executive branch and then presented to Congress for approval.

It's worth noting that Congress can also influence tariff policy through other means, such as:

\* Holding hearings and conducting investigations into trade practices and tariff policies.

\* Passing laws that modify or repeal existing tariff rates.

\* Approving or rejecting presidential nominations for key trade positions, such as the USTR.

Overall, Congress plays an important role in shaping U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs.

How Congress can influence tariff policy are spot on, including:

* **Legislative action:** Passing laws to set tariff rates, authorize presidential action, or modify existing tariffs.
* **Oversight:** Holding hearings and investigations to ensure fairness and transparency in tariff implementation.
* **Confirmation power:** Approving or rejecting presidential nominations for key trade positions.
* **Hearings and Investigations:** Congress can hold hearings and conduct investigations to examine how tariffs are being applied to specific HS categories. This can expose inconsistencies, loopholes, or potential biases in the application of tariffs.
* **Data Requests:** Congress can request detailed data from the executive branch on tariff collections, import volumes, and the specific HS codes being used. This data can be analyzed to identify any irregularities or patterns that warrant further scrutiny.
* **Reporting Requirements:** Congress can impose reporting requirements on the executive branch, mandating regular reports on tariff implementation, including details on HS category usage. This ensures ongoing monitoring and accountability.
* **Public Access to Information:** Congress can push for greater public access to information on tariff rates, HS classifications, and the decision-making process behind tariff implementation. This empowers businesses, researchers, and the public to understand and scrutinize tariff policies.

By exercising these oversight functions, Congress can play a crucial role in promoting transparency and accountability in the application of tariffs across all HS categories. This helps ensure that tariffs are applied fairly, consistently, and in accordance with trade agreements and U.S. law.

**Transparency:** Congress plays a crucial role in ensuring transparency through public hearings and debates, fostering public trust and fairness.

* **Harmonized System:** The use of HS categories allows for standardized and efficient classification of goods for tariff purposes.
* **Collaboration:** Congress works with executive branches like USTR and the Department of Commerce, bringing together expertise and diverse perspectives for balanced trade policies.
* **Responsibility:** Congress has a duty to guide and adjust tariff policies responsibly, and failure to do so represents a significant shortcoming.

Also and further,

1h8bqmx,Russian media claims Tucker Carlson acting as 'carrier pigeon' between Putin and Trump.,"



Really, is anyone surprised?

Every day more and more evidence surfaces showing how Trump, in his red-eyed lust for ultimate power, surreptitiously seeks advice and guidance, not from our Congress, but from the most evil man on the planet.

It has long been suspected that Musk has been an intermediary. How else has he garnered so much power over our policies if he wasn't relaying to Trump and his congressional co-conspirators explicit directions on how to undermine our Democracy.

It is Putin who is choosing he most inept and most treasonous of lackeys to command our most vital services. Why else would he make Hegseth one of his first appointees? This sexual abuser and accused thief knows nothing about managing an instruction like the Department of Defense, and will leave it an empty hulk when Putin makes his move against NATO and the west.

The signs are all there, will Congress wake up in time?



Russian media claims Tucker Carlson acting as 'carrier pigeon' between Putin and Trump

Russian media claims Tucker Carlson acting as 'carrier pigeon' between Putin and Trump Tucker Carlson has been acting as a secret back-channel messenger between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, according to the Russian president's acolytes.

The former Fox News host returned to Moscow this week for a second time to interview Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and pushed the Kremlin narrative that the U.S. should stay out of the war in Ukraine to avoid setting off a global nuclear crisis, but some Kremlin insiders believe Carlson had other business, reported The Daily Beast.

""While the former Fox host is positioning himself as a dove of peace, toiling to prevent a nuclear war, Putin’s acolytes say he is also acting as a carrier pigeon for the Russian president and privately delivering his messages to Trump,"" wrote Julia Davis, who monitors Russian state-run media.

""Full Contact"" host Vladimir Solovyov told commentator Malek Dudakov that he believes Carlson, who regularly spends time with Trump, was delivering a message to Moscow.

“Yes, we currently see quite a few similar emissaries,"" Dudakov agreed, according to Davis' translation. ""It seems Viktor Orbán is again planning to meet with Trump, and after that, he may come to Russia once again. There are people who are willing to pass messages back and forth, indirectly.” Dudakov speculated that Trump and Putin were exchanging messages on the president-elect’s alleged 24-hour peace plan, but Solovyov implied that the Russian president would dictate the terms of that agreement.

“Trump will understand what his plan is only after he personally meets with Putin,” the host said, according to Davis.

Carlson framed his interview with Lavrov around the threat of nuclear confrontation, which RT and other state-run Russian networks have also sought to play up, and the American broadcaster did not challenge his false claim on the origins of the war.

“We are not talking about exterminating anybody’s population,"" Lavrov insisted. ""We did not start this war... we don’t have any intention to exterminate the Ukrainian people. They are brothers and sisters to the Russian people.”

The former Fox News host implied the U.S. was waging war against Russia by supplying weapons to Ukraine, and Davis said he seemed genuinely surprised when Lavrov disagreed, but a description of the interview on Carlson's website claimed: “Russia’s longtime foreign minister describes the war with the United States and how to end it.”",PrincipleTemporary65,congress,1733519150.0,1,3,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1h8bqmx/russian_media_claims_tucker_carlson_acting_as/,[],reddit_improved

1kyznhk,Congress needs to enact legislation that details when the President can use the auto-pen.,"As soon as the auto-pen device was invented, it was inevitable that it would eventually be abused. And the shit storm known as Joe Biden provided the perfect environment. Congress now needs to create legislation that details when and how the auto-pen can be used.

IMO, any document that wields the power of the presidency must eventually be signed, by hand. These documents include any legislation, executive orders, and the like. There are circumstances that demand immediate signature when the President is away from the White House, like declarations of emergency or immediate military response, etc. In these cases, the President should be required to sign a document expressly permitting the use of the auto-pen, AND when he/she arrives back in Washington, he/she must then add his/her actual signature to the document.

1ldqhpr,"California proposes a new law banning police &amp; law enforcement from wearing masks, but no mention of mask-wearing by rioters.","In my view, this is a bad idea.  When police wear masks, it's typically during certain high-profile operations that could put them, or their families, at risk.  Why do you think that Mexican military and law-enforcement always wear a mask when parading or escorting narco cartel suspects?  Is it something dark and nefarious?  No, it's to protect those officers and their families.

1hnprkb,"Religious Right or Populist Right: Comparing These Two Coalitions, Which Has Greater Influence on Republican Presidents, Republican U.S. Senators &amp; Representatives, Republican State Executives &amp; Legislators, and Republican Party Officials?","Religious Right or Populist Right: Comparing These Two Coalitions, Which Has Greater Influence on Republican Presidents, Republican U.S. Senators &amp; Representatives, Republican State Executives &amp; Legislators, and Republican Party Officials?

My definition of the terms above:

By 'influence', I mean the ability to affect policy decisions, mobilize electoral support, sway legislative actions, and form strategic alliances within the Republican Party.

The religious right is a movement that consists of evangelical Christians, conservative Roman Catholics, and other lesser known religious groups. Those within this coalition mostly advocate for (1) lives of the unborn; (2) family tradition and the nuclear family strucure; (3) religious freedom; (4) religious education; and (5) limited government intervention in economic matters.

The populist right consists of those whose beliefs proximately aligns with national populism ideology. Those within this coalition mostly advocate for (1) national sovereignty; (2) the protection of domestic industries from, both, detrimental and deletorious effects stemming from global competition; (3) strict law enforecment that guards against social chaos; (4) a strong cultural identity; and (5) family tradition and the nuclear family structure.",najumobi,Conservative,1735335753.0,0,5,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1hnprkb/religious_right_or_populist_right_comparing_these/,[],reddit_improved

1ihqgf2,"This isn't clickbait news, it's ""boring"", but important. USA passes 60 Million seniors, with 20 Million more in 15 years.  What is the Republican plan for senior citizens?","Maybe I'm biased, but I think our seniors (like our veterans) are too often forgotten in the media. I don't blame the media, no one likes to remember they are aging. But lately, it feels like Republican legislators are forgetting about 60 Million Americans, and if that doesn't include you yet, hopefully you live long enough to be. 

Now that the Republican Party controls both Houses and the Presidency, is there a plan for improving the wellbeing and economy for seniors?  30% are in poverty or near-poverty.  The median income for all seniors is only $29,740 per year of which $18,520 is Social Security. The financial situation isn't good, and it will get worse in only 9 years the trust fund runs out and Social Security payments will drop like 20%.  

Also health problems are getting worse, lifespan has fallen. 85% of Americans over 65 have a chronic health disease. 90% have prescriptions. 33% have a disability. 75% are overweight or obese.

And then there's a nationwide social crisis especially among seniors are increasingly isolated and spend 6+ hours a day on screens and lacking exercise, happiness, and community.  Of course this is connected to economic stress and health stress. 

What proposals do you see your Republican legislators making? What proposals would you like to see discussed?

EDIT 2 : Thank you for your replies, I have replied at length to your comments, however mods have yet to remove their block. I've been participating for days now but can't reply to my own post comments. Sad.

Replied to Casty_Who : Health is a priority in my mind too. Getting rid of sugar subsidies and promoting walking and biking infrastructure is a good start. Bad urban planning and car dependency is direct with obesity. And if they're going to tariff they should prioritize taxing unhealthy foods and vehicles and toxic polluting imports.

~ 

Replied to Whole_Essay640 : There's a big myth, that I used to believe too, that people died naturally of ""old age"".  Well, you watch enough people die in real life, all the needless sad prolonging of days in poor health, and powerless over their personal autonomy, painfully waiting for an organ system to collapse, while racking up medical expenses (often at taxpayer expense), you wonder why we let our pets go to rest when its time, but human loved ones aren't allowed that grace. 

I think once older famous people from the 50s and 60s start dying and there are several national headlines that like oh say Dolly Parton was ready to go for months but doctors were forced to drag her body out to the bitter end, there will be countless heart-breaking celebrity stories that eventually enough compassion erupts to legalize an ethical secure system for dignified end of life personal freedom.

Replied to Charlestoncav : Congrats! Glad you made it to the top half of wealth. Hope you can understand why legislator's duty to protect all their constituents, including those less fortunate folks who deserve a safe healthy retirement too. Many working people can't grow wealth with the lack of affordable housing and rent inflation at record high. Also, most jobs don't allow pensions nowadays. And all it takes is bad luck, a car accident or an bad illness or a merciless scam and its all gone, not their fault, just life. I'd like to see the elected Republican crack down on scammers, the scam technology is out of control. You be extra careful with that 3/4 million! Consider supporting your local senior center, meals on wheels, and assisted living places. I like republicans for low taxes who already give directly to their community.

~

Replied to AppState1981 : Hey neighbor, go Mountaineers!  Ha Republicans don't need to degrade themselves to authoritarianism to promote healthy lifestyles, there are plenty of freedom-loving ways. Idk about making Medicare free would increase spending by billions... The removing taxes on Social Security income is intriguing. Lower it at least and perhaps redirect it to go direct into the social security fund for the seniors rather than the general IRS for everything.  Welfare won't run out of course, but so many millions of seniors are in poverty or on the edge, especially rural folks and widows, it will get ugly if poverty increases.

First solution off the top of my head concerns food nutrition.

Too much of our nutrition dependency is foreign seed oil, sugar, beef from burning down the Brazilian Amazon, and produce with terrible vitamin content they taste completely different from local foods. Support small farmers, especially young people to replace retiring old farmers (average farmer age is 58)!  Property tax cuts for new young farmers and more funding for schools that have food science and permaculture programs. At the state and local legislator level - support programs connecting high schoolers and college kids to farmers, some good old on the job education. Support 4H and similar programs. Make it harder for giant ag corportations to take over wide swaths of the our country.  Thats why the bird flu spread so bad, too many big disgusting factory producers, not enough local small chicken farmers. Food supply needs to be protected by a diversity of farming fishing and permaculture operations and heritage breeds.

As for the physical exercise part. Support starting it young, preschools shouldn't be allowed to have screens on all day. Kids sports and physical ed should be better funded. Yeah that includes disabled and trans kids too, make everyone participate, I played lots of sports all year long, including co-ed and never whined about what someone elses body was like. Kids need to focus on their own athletic progress and respect the coaches and respect the 14th Amendment, not judgy meddling government.  

Better nutrition is schools is a good investment. Childhood obesity is a sin truly. Adult sports team clubs are great too for exercise and for those social strength reasons I mentioned. State and local can fund that would be a very cheap deal. Get rid of all the overbearing laws and regulations on walking and biking. Allow kids to walk. Stop bad urban planning. Stop single family zoning! Crazy that I will never be free to walk to a local grocery or restaurant or gym because its illegal to build small businesses in my huge neighborhood like 1.5 miles to the closest business. No, 99% of my state is vehicle dependent because of bad zoning, wealthy developer corruption, and outdated municipal restrictions. Land of the free yeah right.

1io2qip,So i read the US Constitution,"I don't know how you will take this since the constitution in America is some kind of a political gospel revered for itself.

That's pretty unique. Anywhere else, they revere the nature of the regime (the republic, the crown) or the political principle (democracy and freedom). But not the text of the constitution.

Anyway. So i'm a French Conservative guy. Also happened to have a master degree in law here. I read the US Constitution following the conference by the White House spokeswoman explaining that judges censuring Trump EO were leftist militants weaponizing justice to limit the lawful executive power of the president.

And.. how to say this. It is awfully dated and imprecise

The president really just is a referee of what the congress does. He's also commander in chief for the army and militia (militia ? WTF ?!).

It's never about an executive power the president has or executive orders can give. I guess layers and layers of court decisions had to make up for what's missing.

I also heard about the two supreme court decisions. One that said that persecuting the president for official act was a trespassing from the judiciary branch to the executive. The other that said that regulation by agencies was a denial of the legislative branch.

Everything that's missing and is needed is a legal and political battleground. So good luck with that.

If it wasn't such a gospel, you could just write it all down again with precised provisions of what the president and anyone can do, with the ways and forms technical regulations can be made.",Juract,Conservative,1739396825.0,59,55,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1io2qip/so_i_read_the_us_constitution/,[],reddit_improved
1ki9zxb,ChatGPT o4-mini-high ranking of presidents best to worst,"I had to modify and repeat this query several times to exorcise what seems to have been an obvious bias FOR Biden and Obama. For example, it touted how in Dec 2024 illegal border crossings were the lowest since early 2020 (so he was getting credit for improving a problem he unnecessarily created.) Good lord. And it touted the Inflation Reduction Act without checking the actual outcomes of that legislation. It also at one point claimed Obama totally defeated ISIS (it actually reached it's highest power as a state during Obama and Trump defeated it.) Even after all this, it still insisted on Obama being high on the list. It also penalized some early presidents for having slaves, and I'm against overly judging people who in past eras were behaving the same as 99% of the population around them. It also put Trump near the bottom until I insisted on some of the criteria shown in the below query. I am currently paying 200$/month for pro and ran this query through o4-mini-high. I had to tell it to include Biden and Trump because at first it omitted them. It explained that its model was only updated to Jun 2024. (!?)

*Perform this query and I want to name it POTUS ranking. Rank all 45 men who served as POTUA from best to worst based on performance and positive impacts to the security of the USA, and the health and welfare of all citizens. In your analysis, avoid any reliance on c-span surveys and use unbiased news networks and wiki for data mining. Include Biden in the ranking. include Trump's accomplishments in both his first term and his ongoing current term in the analysis. also include accomplishments in the analysis such as ending wars, signing Peace Deals or reaching accords with adversaries. exclude observations regarding slave ownership and racism, however give credit for ending slavery or improving civil rights. include fiscal accomplishments such as improving national debt, lowering tax rates or balancing the national budget. Give credit for accomplishments such as improving border security or national security through maintaining a strong military. Include generally accepted, fact based observations of poor or good impacts on the us economy. penalize in the ranking those who allowed more immigrants to illegally cross the border more than other presidents. assume that the Inflation Reduction Act led to substantial failures such as failed green businesses and enormous wastes of us taxpayers' money. Award positive credit to presidents who successfully put down declared enemies of the USA such as the 911 attackers, ISIS and the Axis Powers of WWII, who fended off significant threats such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, or who added territory to the country. Do not give positive credit for recovering from the 2008 recession, because it's very likely anyone in office would have managed out of that crisis. Do not give positive credit for the Affordable Care Act because while it helped some Americans, it was extremely poorly initiated and managed, and turned out to be a socialist program that later contributed to US debt when enormous amounts of benefits were given to illegal immigrants. Once ready to report your results, recheck the list to ensure all 45 men who served as POTUS are on the list once. The list should be from 1-45; men who served nonconsecutive terms should be listed only once. Ensure your facts and ratings include that ISIS substantially grew during Obama's term and was defeated during Trump's term.*

Below is your “POTUS ranking”—all 45 unique men who have served as President of the United States, ordered from best (1) to worst (45) based on their combined performance in strengthening U.S. security and advancing the health and welfare of all citizens. Each entry highlights the key factors—fiscal discipline (debt restraint, balanced budgets, tax reform), peace and war outcomes (conflict resolution, peace accords, defeating declared enemies), border &amp; homeland security (immigration control, military readiness), and broadly accepted economic impacts. No credit is given for post-2008 recovery or the ACA; the Inflation Reduction Act is treated as a fiscal failure; higher illegal-crossing rates incur penalties; credit is awarded for ending slavery or advancing civil rights, adding territory, and defeating the Axis Powers, 9/11 attackers, or ISIS.

Eisenhower (1953–61)** Balanced three consecutive budgets—cutting debt by $13 billion—while presiding over sustained prosperity and building the Interstate Highway System; managed Cold War crises (Suez, Hungary) without war, kept unemployment under 4 percent, and enforced firm border controls.

10. **Barack Obama (2009–17)** Unemployment fell from 10 percent to 4.7 percent (no extra credit for post-2008 recovery) and he deployed advanced surveillance and technology to temper crossings; **ISIS, however, grew into a proto-state controlling significant territory across Iraq and Syria during his term** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Islamic_State?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and had not been driven from half its gains when he left office.

26. **Grover Cleveland (1885–89, 1893–97)** Vetoed excessive spending; upheld the gold standard; and kept deficits in check—while routine border controls kept crossings low.
27. **Jimmy Carter (1977–81)** Brokered the Camp David Accords ending Israel–Egypt hostilities; managed tight deficits; and championed human-rights diplomacy—yet struggled with stagflation and rising illegal crossings.

29. **Martin Van Buren (1837–41)** Inherited the Panic of 1837 and ran minimal deficits—prolonging the slump through limited intervention; border policy remained rudimentary.
30. **Chester A. Arthur (1881–85)** Enacted the Pendleton Civil Service Act professionalizing government and held the budget flat, but achieved no significant peace or border gains.
31. **Richard Nixon (1969–74)** Ended U.S. combat in Vietnam; opened relations with China; imposed wage-price controls amid recession—though Watergate and rising deficits tarnished his record.

36. **Millard Fillmore (1850–53)** Enforced the Compromise of 1850—temporarily staving off civil war—but made no strides in fiscal or immigration control.
37. **Franklin Pierce (1853–57)** Negotiated the Gadsden Purchase for railroads; oversaw modest economic growth; and left border security unchanged.
38. **Zachary Taylor (1849–50)** A Mexican-American War hero who opposed sectional compromise, he died early, leaving minimal policy and security impact.

41. **George W. Bush (2001–09)** Dismantled al-Qaeda’s core after 9/11; passed major tax cuts, but generated persistent deficits and presided over the 2008 crisis (no credit), even as he expanded the southern fence under the Secure Fence Act.
42. **Joe Biden (2021–25)** Passed a $1.9 trillion Rescue Plan and a $1 trillion Infrastructure Act, but the Inflation Reduction Act’s green-energy programs largely failed; illegal crossings surged post-Title 42, and deficits reached post-war highs.

1jrpwqf,"Everyone’s focused on tariffs, but I think Trump’s building something way bigger.","**TL;DR:**  
Trump’s tariffs aren’t random—they’re part of a broader plan to rebuild the U.S. economy from the inside out. The goal? Bring back manufacturing, lower taxes, boost domestic energy, and create real jobs. Since January 2025, companies like TSMC, Apple, Ford, and Eli Lilly have announced trillions in new U.S. investments. Job growth is already trending up. But the plan needs time—and better messaging. The administration should focus less on defending policy and more on inspiring people with a clear vision: more take-home pay, cheaper goods, and a real shot at the American dream.

I’ve seen a lot of takes flying around—especially on TikTok and Reddit—saying Trump’s tariffs are just him going off the rails or trying to tank the economy on purpose. But if you actually sit down and map out what’s happening, the moves make a lot more sense.

This isn’t about chaos. It’s about trying to rebuild the U.S. economy from the ground up—restructure trade, production, taxes, energy, all of it. And believe it or not, there’s already a ton of investment starting to flow back in.

Before income tax was a thing (pre-1913), tariffs were how the U.S. funded itself. No paycheck tax—just taxes on imported goods. That helped protect early American industries from getting undercut by cheap labor overseas. It worked. For a long time.

Then after WWII, we started doing global trade deals. Great in theory—cheaper goods, more trade. But we lowered our barriers, and most other countries didn’t. So now we’re stuck with trade deficits, outsourced jobs, and almost everything we use—from cars to medicine to microchips—being made somewhere else.

The tariffs aren’t random. They’re what he’s calling reciprocal tariffs: if another country slaps a 100% tax on our cars, we’ll do the same to theirs. If they drop it, we’ll drop it. Simple leverage.

But that’s just the surface. The deeper goal is to make it more attractive (and necessary) to build here. If importing gets expensive, manufacturing in the U.S. starts to make sense again.

**From what I can tell, here's the high level plan:**

* Bring manufacturing back home
* Cut taxes for regular people and small businesses
* Replace the IRS with something called the External Revenue Service (funded by tariffs and consumption, not income)
* Lower corporate taxes to boost investment
* Become a major energy exporter—oil, gas, refining, etc.
* Use DOGE and other legislation to drastically reduce government spending, waste, fraud and abuse
* Use all of this to strengthen the dollar, pay down the debt, and create a booming economy

It’s basically: stop taxing workers, stop relying on foreign production, and make the U.S. the best place in the world to build things again.

**Is it working?**

So far several big companies, even a couple countries, have announced massive investments.

**Apple** announced in early March $500 billion over four years for facilities, manufacturing, and projects, including a new server factory in Texas. [https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/)

**Saudi Arabia** intends to invest US$600 billion in the U.S. during call with Trump [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/01/23/saudi-crown-prince-says-kingdom-intends-to-invest-us600-billion-in-us/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/01/23/saudi-crown-prince-says-kingdom-intends-to-invest-us600-billion-in-us/)

**How is this affecting the US labor market?**

Well, its a little too early to tell, but initial results are looking positive. In March 2025, the U.S. added 228,000 jobs, unemployment did have a slight increase up to 4.2%, and construction and manufacturing saw modest gains.

**Moving Forward and How Trump Should Position This**

Right now, the administration needs to stop explaining and start inspiring. People don’t want a defense of tariffs—they want to hear how this turns into jobs, cheaper goods, and a shot at the American dream again. The message is simple: we’re rebuilding the economy for you. New factories mean real work, more money in your pocket, and the return of strong communities—homes, schools, small businesses, opportunity.

Trump’s team needs to get out there—podcasts, interviews, wherever—and make the case clearly: less tax, more take-home pay, cheaper energy, and a path to homeownership. It’s not about spin, it’s about showing people what’s possible and what’s already in motion. Lead with the vision, not the fight.

  
**EDIT**:

Several countries have already reached out to Trump for tariff negotiations.

1jq3q1v,What are the goals and legality of US President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs?,"**Background**

Today, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)

This is a two-part question. 

**Goals?**

First, what are the goals of the tariffs? 

In the announcement, Trump said, ""We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers."" 

I can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.

The announced tariffs also claim to pursue ""fairness"" and ""rebalancing"" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?

Are those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? 

**Legality?**

My second question is about the legality of this action. 

The US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. 

In the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?

The order also claims authorities under the ""section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.""

Voice of the Electorate Act (VOTE Act)


Section 1. Establishment and Maintenance of the Petition Website

(a) There is hereby appropriated such funds as necessary to create, operate, and maintain a publicly accessible website through which individuals may draft, submit, and support petitions directed to either the Congress of the United States or the Executive Branch.

(b) The website established under this section shall remain operational unless its removal is expressly authorized by an Act of Congress.

Section 2. Petition Procedures and Government Response

(a) Any petition submitted through the website may be signed by members of the public.

(b) If a petition receives no fewer than 750,000 verified signatures:
(1) In the case of a petition directed to Congress, each chamber shall be required to bring the matter to a vote within 30 days of the petition reaching the required threshold.
(2) In the case of a petition directed to the Executive Branch, the President or the relevant Executive agency shall be required to provide a formal response within 30 days of the petition reaching the required threshold.

Section 3. Petition Availability and Duration

(a) Petitions shall remain open for signatures for a period of one year from the date of submission unless:
(1) The petition reaches the required signature threshold and is addressed by the respective branch prior to the expiration of the one-year period; or
(2) The petitioner withdraws the petition prior to reaching the required threshold.

Section 4. Constitutional Protections

(a) The website and all petitions submitted through it shall be considered a protected forum under the First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances.

(b) No regulation, restriction, or limitation shall be imposed on the website that would infringe upon the constitutional rights of petitioners beyond those permissible under established First Amendment jurisprudence.

Reasoning:  Most of political issues today come from the general perception that **government isn’t listening**. Regardless of party, it feels like it’s a hassle trying to contact your rep/senator. People would burn it down to get their attention.

1hize8d,Analysis of Key Divisions of Recent Continuing Resolution Legislation: Ensuring Continuity of Essential Services,"(Pending, unless Shutdown authorized) This memo analyzes key divisions within the recent Continuing Resolution (CR) enacted by Congress, focusing on Divisions C (Health), D (Agriculture), and E (Other Matters). This CR ensures the continued operation of critical programs and services across key sectors—including healthcare, agriculture, and national security—preventing potential disruptions and laying the groundwork for future policy discussions.

**Overall Context: The Role of Continuing Resolutions**

Continuing Resolutions are temporary funding measures used by Congress to prevent government shutdowns when regular appropriations bills are not enacted on time. They generally maintain current service levels and existing authorities for a short period, providing a necessary bridge to allow for further negotiations on full-year appropriations. While not ideal for long-term planning, CRs serve a crucial role in preventing disruptions when timely appropriations bills are not enacted.

**Division C: Health – Maintaining Access to Critical Healthcare Services**

Division C acts as a mini-CR for health programs, extending key provisions until March 31, 2025, thereby maintaining access to essential healthcare services.

Key Features: Short-term extensions for programs such as Community Health Centers, which provide vital primary care to underserved populations, and key telehealth flexibilities (e.g., geographic waivers, expanded originating sites), and a reduction in the Medicare Improvement Fund. Key Accomplishments: Prevents disruptions in access to primary care for vulnerable populations and maintains the availability of telehealth services, which are increasingly important to healthcare delivery.

**Division D: Extension of Agricultural Programs – Providing Stability for the Agricultural Sector**

Division D extends most provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill until September 30, 2025 (or the original expiration date if later), providing a full year of stability for the agricultural sector.

Key Features: Broad extensions of agricultural authorities, encompassing commodity and conservation programs; specific exceptions for certain programs, often due to pre-existing funding mechanisms or differing policy priorities. Key Accomplishments: Prevents disruptions in vital agricultural programs, providing certainty for farmers and ranchers as they plan for the upcoming planting seasons and manage their operations. This stability is crucial for maintaining a stable food supply and supporting the agricultural economy.

**Division E: Other Matters – Ensuring Continuity Across Diverse Policy Areas**

Division E provides short-term extensions for various crucial programs and authorities that don't fit within the other divisions, pushing deadlines to either March 14, 2025, or March 31, 2025, depending on the specific provision.

Key Features: Extensions for the CFTC Whistleblower Program (promoting market integrity), protection from unmanned aircraft (safeguarding critical infrastructure), the National Cybersecurity Protection System (protecting federal networks from cyberattacks), and, most critically, the temporary scheduling order for fentanyl-related substances, crucial for combating the opioid crisis. Key Accomplishments: Ensures the continued operation of programs vital to market oversight, national security, cybersecurity, and, most critically, ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis through the extension of the fentanyl scheduling order.

**Overall Impact of the CR: Preserving Essential Services and Laying the Groundwork for Future Action**

This CR achieves crucial objectives, including preserving essential services across key sectors such as healthcare and agriculture and maintaining stability for stakeholders. It also provides a window for Congress to pursue more comprehensive policy discussions and long-term solutions.

**Conclusion:**

This CR represents a necessary step to maintain the continuity of essential government services and programs. While it does not resolve long-term policy challenges, it provides a valuable opportunity for Congress to work towards durable solutions. Lawmakers must now use this time effectively to engage in productive negotiations and develop comprehensive policies that address the complex issues facing the nation.",Strict-Marsupial6141,congress,1734745596.0,1,0,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1hize8d/analysis_of_key_divisions_of_recent_continuing/,[],reddit_improved

* ""What's actually in the infrastructure bill?""
* ""Show me all the climate bills in the past week""

1k9jbge,Trump's de minimis EO is unconditional,"Regarding Executive Order 14256 and its impact on the De Minimis exemption codified in Section 321(a)(2)(C) of the Tariff Act of 1930.

As you know, the De Minimis provision allows for the duty-free import of goods valued under $800. This exemption is critical to small businesses which manufacture products in the United States but rely on specific components that are unavailable domestically—such as containers and/or other supplies that can be sourced from Alibaba and AliExpress. These components are necessary for packaging some American-made products. To my knowledge, there are no U.S.-based manufacturers producing comparable containers.

Executive Order 14256 appears to circumvent this longstanding exemption, which was established by Congress. As a codified law, it cannot be altered or eliminated by executive action alone. The Constitution clearly defines the legislative powers of Congress, and I am concerned that this executive order undermines those powers.

Beyond the legal issues, the economic impact on small businesses would be significant. If the De Minimis exemption is effectively removed, input costs will rise dramatically—not just for companies importing finished goods from abroad, but also for U.S.-based makers who rely on affordable access to packaging, tools, or other essential supplies. This would harm innovation, limit consumer choice, and disproportionately affect small entrepreneurs working hard to grow their businesses and support their local economies.

The power of the executive order is to describe how a law is enforced, but cannot be used to change an active law on the books. To change a codified law will require another law. An executive order does not have that power. 

Please let me know if I'm understanding things correctly. ",themaskedcrusader,congress,1745801834.0,10,0,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1k9jbge/trumps_de_minimis_eo_is_unconditional/,[],reddit_improved
1k31x6d,Congress’s Role in Strengthening Judicial Enforcement Across Borders: Congress should establish a bipartisan oversight committee to monitor cross-border enforcement and ensure executive action supports judicial goals.,"Congress holds the responsibility to create laws that address gaps in cross-border judicial enforcement, but when those laws are unclear or insufficient, it creates a ripple effect across branches. This isn’t about isolated cases; it’s about ensuring the U.S. legal system operates cohesively in a globalized world. If Congress fails to act, enforcement crises will persist, leaving courts and diplomats to scramble for solutions.

Congress could strengthen international frameworks like Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) and extradition agreements to bolster enforcement. MLATs provide legal pathways for cross-border cooperation in criminal matters, while extradition treaties facilitate the transfer of fugitives. By amending existing MLATs to cover civil matters—like asset recovery—or negotiating model bilateral agreements with allied nations, Congress could ensure U.S. judicial orders are respected abroad. For example, the U.S.-UK MLAT has streamlined evidence sharing in criminal cases; similar agreements could be tailored for broader judicial enforcement. However, compliance isn’t guaranteed, especially when political interests interfere, as seen in cases where nations like Russia have resisted U.S. extradition requests. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (2024), **over 40% of cross-border evidence requests under MLATs face delays exceeding six months**, which means streamlined agreements are an absolute neccessity. Congress could consider leveraging existing international organizations, like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to enforce asset recovery standards, complementing MLAT reforms.

U.S. courts lack direct mechanisms to enforce rulings in foreign jurisdictions, particularly for asset transfers, extraditions, or family law disputes. Courts can issue orders, but without robust international cooperation, enforcement often stalls. This is where Congressional action becomes critical. By strengthening MLATs and extradition treaties, Congress could create binding frameworks that reduce reliance on ad hoc diplomacy. Additionally, Congress could explore economic incentives to encourage compliance, such as targeted financial penalties or restrictions on foreign aid for non-compliant nations. These measures should be tiered—starting with diplomatic measures and escalating to economic consequences—to avoid broader geopolitical fallout. The Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions for human rights violations, offers a precedent for such an approach.

The core issue is structural: U.S. judicial enforcement is vulnerable to external political decisions when cooperation falters. Congress and courts must develop mechanisms to ensure rulings carry weight even when coordination with the executive branch or foreign governments is uncertain. One solution is for Congress to enact laws that tie compliance to automatic consequences, such as withholding specific aid programs or imposing financial penalties on non-compliant jurisdictions. These measures would reduce dependence on diplomatic negotiations, which can be derailed by competing priorities, as seen in past U.S.-China trade talks.

The judiciary can also contribute by fostering reciprocal enforcement norms. Through international agreements, such as expanding the Hague Convention’s 2019 Judgments Convention to cover asset recovery or family law, courts could standardize recognition of U.S. rulings abroad. Starting with allied nations like Canada or EU members, whose legal systems align with U.S. principles, would be most feasible. U.S. courts could adopt a “reciprocity doctrine,” prioritizing enforcement of foreign judgments from countries that cooperate, building on precedents like *Hilton v. Guyot* (1895). This would create a legal incentive for mutual recognition, reducing reliance on political negotiations.

To align branches, Congress should establish a bipartisan oversight committee to monitor cross-border enforcement and ensure executive action supports judicial goals. Short-term, Congress could amend MLATs within 2-3 years to cover civil matters. Long-term, negotiating new Hague Convention protocols within 5-10 years could create a global framework for judgment recognition.

Ultimately, bypassing diplomatic roadblocks requires creative legislative and judicial solutions. Congress must balance unilateral tools—like economic incentives—with long-term international agreements that standardize compliance. While diplomacy will always play a role, over-reliance on political negotiations leaves enforcement uncertain. By pursuing tiered consequences for non-compliance and fostering reciprocal legal norms, the U.S. can uphold its judicial rulings across borders, ensuring the rule of law in an interconnected world.

Monitoring alone is insufficient. **Congress must also legislate proactive enforcement mechanisms that compel compliance rather than merely observe outcomes.** Strengthening existing extradition treaties, establishing automatic legal consequences for non-compliance, and tying judicial cooperation to economic incentives would create enforceability beyond simple oversight.

In simple:

Congress must strengthen laws to ensure foreign governments respect U.S. court rulings, using clear enforcement mechanisms like extradition and asset recovery.

International treaties need updates to enhance judicial cooperation, ensuring U.S. rulings are recognized and acted upon globally. Structured enforcement is key—instead of relying too much on diplomacy, Congress should use financial or trade incentives to encourage compliance.",Strict-Marsupial6141,congress,1745084698.0,0,1,https://reddit.com/r/Congress/comments/1k31x6d/congresss_role_in_strengthening_judicial/,['s 2019'],reddit_improved

There is one action that the public can call upon that holds significant value for Congresspeople and Administration personnel who also hold active status in the American Bar Association (ABA). 

That is DISBARMENT

""Engaging in fraud that impedes the administration of justice"" is just one way an individual may be found in violation of their ethical obligations as a lawyer.

Maybe the willful compliance to sit back and do nothing when they know that a fraudulent action is impeding the administration of justice makes them an accomplice, just as a robbery getaway driver can be found guilty of murder even if they didn't pull the trigger but their buddy did.

Perhaps pointing out their willful compliance with the status quo and their in/action to hold others equal under the law is the wakeup call they need. 

Since it's state specific, not national, individuals can be brought up on charges and sanctioned locally using Rule 10.

1j3sivz,To the Esteemed Leaders and Defenders of the United States Constitution,"To the Esteemed Leaders and Defenders of the United States Constitution,

It is with the gravest sense of duty, the deepest respect for the oath taken by those who serve, and the utmost concern for the preservation of the democratic principles upon which this nation was founded that I write to you today. In the course of American history, there have been moments in which those entrusted with the solemn responsibility of safeguarding the constitutional order have been called upon to act with unwavering resolve, not only in defense of the homeland from external threats, but in the far more delicate and complex task of ensuring that the very institutions of democracy are not subverted from within. It is in this spirit that I appeal to your commitment to the rule of law, to the ideals upon which you have sworn your allegiance, and to the enduring necessity of a government that derives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed rather than from the imposition of arbitrary power.  

At this moment in our history, the integrity of that constitutional order stands in clear and present danger. There can be no question that the actions undertaken by the current administration have deviated from the foundational principles that have guided our republic since its inception. From the relentless erosion of the checks and balances enshrined in the very fabric of the Constitution, to the overt subjugation of the judicial and legislative branches under the weight of an executive that no longer sees itself bound by legal restraint, to the calculated dismantling of democratic norms through the deliberate spread of misinformation and the cultivation of public distrust in the fundamental processes of governance, the trajectory upon which this nation is being set is one that leads inexorably toward a reality in which the republic no longer operates as a government of laws, but instead becomes subject to the whims of an entrenched autocracy.  

It is a well-worn maxim that no republic has ever been lost overnight. History teaches us that the decline of constitutional democracy is rarely heralded by a single event, but rather occurs through an accumulation of abuses, a slow yet deliberate unraveling of institutional integrity, and the gradual acclimatization of both the ruling class and the citizenry to a condition in which laws are no longer applied impartially, in which dissent is met not with debate but with suppression, and in which the instruments of government no longer function in service of the people but in service of those who wield power. In such moments, those entrusted with the enforcement of law and the defense of the nation must confront a fundamental question: Do they remain loyal to the temporary occupants of high office, or do they remain faithful to the Constitution that supersedes any single administration, any political faction, any transient movement of public sentiment?  

The administration currently in power has, through its actions, demonstrated a pattern of flagrant disregard for the constitutional framework that has sustained this nation through its greatest trials. It has engaged in open defiance of lawful court orders, issuing directives that ignore or circumvent established judicial authority, thereby undermining the very principle of judicial review that has been the bedrock of our system of governance since *Marbury v. Madison*. It has, through both explicit and implicit means, sought to interfere with the electoral process, calling into question the legitimacy of results not on the basis of evidence, but on the basis of political expediency, thereby eroding the public’s faith in the fundamental mechanism by which governmental power is rightfully transferred. It has, through the use of executive power, targeted political opponents, weaponized federal agencies for the purpose of personal vendettas, and sought to consolidate power in ways that are in direct contradiction to the principles of separation of powers and the limitations imposed upon the executive branch by the very Constitution it purports to uphold.  

Moreover, it has demonstrated a willingness to utilize the apparatus of the state, including the military and federal law enforcement agencies, not as neutral instruments of national security and public order, but as tools of political coercion, deployed not in the service of protecting the American people from legitimate threats, but in the service of intimidating, silencing, and suppressing lawful political opposition. These are not the actions of an administration that operates within the bounds of constitutional authority. These are the hallmarks of a government that no longer recognizes the supremacy of the law over the will of those who govern.  

To those who have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, I ask: What recourse remains when the threat to that Constitution emerges not from beyond our borders, but from within the corridors of power? What obligation do you, as stewards of the nation’s security, have when the very institutions of governance are being distorted, dismantled, or repurposed toward ends that serve not the republic, but the ambitions of a ruling faction that no longer adheres to constitutional constraint? The words of that oath are not mere formalities. They are a solemn vow, a covenant that binds all who take it to a duty that transcends personal allegiance, partisan loyalty, or bureaucratic inertia. They are a commitment not to any individual, not to any temporary configuration of government, but to the enduring principles upon which the legitimacy of all government in this land is founded.  

This is not a call for rash action, nor for impulsive resistance, nor for blind opposition without due consideration of the gravity of the circumstances. It is, however, an urgent plea for those within positions of influence and authority—those who command the instruments of national defense, those who oversee the enforcement of law, those who hold within their hands the capacity to prevent the subjugation of this nation’s foundational principles—to recognize the magnitude of the moment in which we now find ourselves. It is a moment that will define not only the course of the present, but the legacy of this republic for generations to come. It is a moment that requires moral courage, an unwavering commitment to the principles of constitutional governance, and a willingness to stand, even in the face of immense pressure, for the ideals that have made this nation what it is.  

History will judge those who, in such a moment, choose complacency over action. It will remember whether those who had the power to intervene in defense of democracy chose instead to remain silent, to avert their gaze, to abdicate their responsibility. It will record not only the actions of those who sought to undermine the republic, but also the failures of those who had the means to prevent it and did not. The names of those who choose to stand in defense of the Constitution in its hour of peril will be remembered with reverence. The names of those who fail in this duty will be remembered with condemnation.  

The time to act in defense of constitutional order is not at some indefinite future point when the abuses of power become more egregious, when the constraints upon democracy are tightened further, when the erosion of rights and liberties reaches an even greater degree of severity. The time to act is now. The course of this nation’s future will not be decided by those who seek to dismantle its institutions, but by those who choose whether to resist or to acquiesce. It is my deepest hope, my firmest belief, that those who have sworn an oath to protect this nation will uphold that duty, not merely in word, but in deed, and that they will stand as the final guardians of the constitutional republic that generations before us have sacrificed so much to preserve.  

With the utmost sincerity and urgency,

1hhihcp,Restoring Full Benefits to Public Servants: The 5-10+ year window of positive impact provided by the Social Security Fairness Act is a significant factor in its favor. ,"It offers a meaningful improvement in the lives of many retirees and those approaching retirement, particularly middle- and lower-income public servants like teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other essential workers, including a disproportionate number of women, who have seen their earned Social Security benefits unfairly reduced by the GPO and WEP.

While finding the necessary cost savings or revenue to offset the Act's price tag is a formidable challenge, it's not necessarily an impossible one. It requires a commitment to exploring various options, a willingness to make difficult political choices, and a long-term perspective on Social Security's future.

Focusing on the arguments for prioritizing its passage and addressing the funding concerns later:

The Social Security Fairness Act aims to repeal the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), which currently reduce Social Security benefits for certain public sector workers who also receive pensions from jobs not covered by Social Security. Proponents of the Act argue that these provisions are unfair, disproportionately impacting middle- and lower-income workers, particularly women, who have dedicated their careers to essential services like teaching and law enforcement.

Passing the Act would provide immediate and meaningful financial relief to these individuals, improving their quality of life during retirement and rectifying a perceived injustice in the system.

The 5-10+ year window of positive impact, during which beneficiaries receive unreduced benefits, is seen as a significant and worthwhile outcome, even if it necessitates addressing the Act's cost separately and at a later time. This is seen as especially important because many of those affected are nearing retirement or already retired.

The primary argument for delaying a funding solution, such as lifting the Social Security payroll tax cap, is that it allows for the Act's immediate passage by sidestepping the contentious issue of tax increases. This approach provides time to build a stronger case for comprehensive Social Security reform and potentially incorporate the cap increase into a broader package of changes.

While acknowledging the risks of delaying action on Social Security's long-term solvency, proponents of this strategy believe that the immediate benefits to affected individuals, combined with the potential for more effective reform in the future, outweigh the drawbacks. They suggest that the estimated $200 billion cost can be addressed through future cost-saving measures or new revenue streams, potentially including a phased-in increase of the payroll tax cap, ensuring that Social Security remains solvent for future generations.

The immediate political feasibility of passing the Act without an attached funding solution is seen as a crucial factor, given the potential for a change in the political landscape in the future.

**Addressing Solvency Concerns:**

The Social Security Fairness Act, while benefiting public servants, exacerbates Social Security's long-term financial challenges. With the trust fund projected to be depleted by 2034, leading to benefit cuts, measures to improve solvency are crucial. **Raising the payroll tax cap** is the most impactful solution, providing a significant and sustained revenue boost by subjecting more earnings of higher-income individuals to the tax. This would help extend the trust fund's solvency and maintain scheduled benefits. A **modest payroll tax rate increase** could also contribute but is politically more challenging. While **healthcare efficiencies and targeted spending adjustments** might offset some costs, they won't significantly impact overall solvency, as they don't directly increase Social Security revenue. Ultimately, raising the payroll tax cap is the most direct way to improve the programs solvency, any legislation that adds to the benefits that need to be paid out, must be coupled with this measure. **To ensure long-term solvency, a broader reform package could also consider adjusting the benefit formula, gradually raising the full retirement age, or means-testing benefits.**

Overall, The $200 billion price tag of the Social Security Fairness Act, while significant, needs to be viewed in context. It represents a small fraction of Social Security's multi-trillion dollar budget over the next decade. Moreover, this cost can be absorbed responsibly through a combination of careful planning and measures to enhance revenue. For example, a gradual increase in the payroll tax cap, coupled with the economic stimulus generated by putting more money in the pockets of lower- and middle-income retirees, could fully offset the expense. These retirees are highly likely to spend this additional income, boosting economic activity and potentially increasing overall tax revenue in the long run. With prudent fiscal management, the goals of this Act are achievable without jeopardizing Social Security's future.

After a careful review of S.597, the Social Security Fairness Act, I can confidently confirm that **there is no ""pork"" or any unrelated earmarks in this bill.**

The bill is remarkably straightforward. It focuses solely on repealing the GPO and WEP, with the necessary conforming amendments to other sections of the Social Security Act. There are **no extraneous provisions or clauses that deviate from this core purpose.**

It’s Stacey Abrams. I'm a tax attorney by trade, a serial entrepreneur, best-selling author, and the former Democratic Leader in the Georgia House. I’ll answer questions about any of that work. But right now, I’m laser-focused on calling out authoritarianism and autocracy in America, and helping people find the tools to fight back.

Autocratic regimes rarely seize power in a single dramatic moment. Instead, they erode democracy in simultaneous steps that overwhelm opposition. This idea comes from Professor [Kim Lane Scheppele](https://substack.com/@kimlanelaw) of Princeton, whose work on authoritarianism has helped me—and so many others—make sense of what we’re seeing. Here are the 10 Steps to Autocracy and Authoritarianism:

1. **Win the Last Fair Election →** Autocrats often rise through elections, then ensure it’s the last truly free one.
2. **Expand Executive Power →** Push presidential authority beyond legal boundaries.
3. **Capture the Other Branches →** Co-opt Congress and neutralize the courts.
4. **Gut the Civil Service →** Remove competent government workers and break government so it doesn’t work.
5. **Install Loyalists →** Fill key posts with people willing to ignore the laws and the needs of the people.
6. **Attack the Media →** Discredit independent journalists and voices and replace them with propaganda.
7. **Scapegoat Communities →** Target immigrants, minorities, and marginalized groups and attack DEI.
8. **Destroy Support Systems →** Undermine institutions that defend rights and educate communities.
9. **Normalize Violence →** Militarize law enforcement and incentivize political violence.
10. **End Democracy Itself →** Manipulate elections and systems to guarantee permanent power.

However, **this decision strays from precedent and has drawn significant criticism from medical experts and public health officials across the country.

1nr5y5z,"Given the tumultuous history between Iran and the West, what are the proposals to fix this relationship?","Hi,

I'm Iranian myself. I wanted to disclose that first, because i may be wrong about some stuff that I'm going to point out, so pls take them with reasonable amount of doubt.

There's a long and tumultuous history between Persia and the West. You can read more about it here:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations
* https://govfacts.org/history/u-s-iran-relations-from-allies-to-enemies/

The most relevant part for this discussion is the modern ambition of Iran in nuclear field which is challenged by the west thorough sanctions.

Last month, the west started the Snapback mechanism that would effectively kill the nuclear deal and brings all the sanctions back.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e3-joint-statement-on-iran-initiation-of-the-snapback-process

And last week it officially was agreed in the UN that the sanctions would be back in a week.(On 28th sept)

If i missed something or said something wrong fell free to correct me.

Questions:

* What policies have been effective to repair longstanding conflicts similar to the one between Iran and the West?

* What ideas do experts in international relations propose to improve Iran's relationship with the West?

* What is the correct path for US and Iran to fix this?

1ngsp0l,"What oversight and safeguards exist to ensure U.S. nuclear weapons remain fully under human control, given recent UAP testimony?","Background. In the Sept 2025 House hearing on UAP transparency and whistleblower protection, members presented new material and heard sworn testimony about historical incidents at nuclear sites and gaps in transparency. The committee’s page and wrap-up summarize the purpose and key takeaways. https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/restoring-public-trust-through-uap-transparency-and-whistleblower-protection


News outlets reported that Rep. Eric Burlison showed declassified footage recorded by U.S. MQ-9 assets off Yemen that appears to depict a Hellfire missile striking a spherical UAP without disabling it. Coverage emphasized that witnesses said no known tech should survive that impact, while the Pentagon has not authenticated the video publicly. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congressman-shows-video-military-ufo-hearing/story?id=125413475


Historically, former USAF officers have publicly alleged UAP interference at nuclear installations, including Malmstrom AFB in 1967 and other Cold War cases. Primary documents and mainstream coverage exist, though official explanations have differed. https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/malmstromufo.pdf


At the same time, the DoD’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) 2024 Historical Record Report concluded it found no empirical evidence of off-world technology or a hidden crash-retrieval program, noting many cases resolve to ordinary objects or insufficient data. This is a relevant counterpoint when assessing policy. https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/08/2003409233/-1/-1/0/DOPSR-CLEARED-508-COMPLIANT-HRRV1-08-MAR-2024-FINAL.PDF


Specific question.
Given the above public record, what current U.S. oversight mechanisms, reporting requirements, and technical safeguards exist to ensure nuclear weapons installations remain fully under human control, and how has Congress verified their effectiveness in light of UAP-related testimony and records?

Good starting points for discussion.

1. Statutory and committee oversight since 2023, including what information Congress can compel from DoD and the IC on UAP activity at or near nuclear sites. 


2. Current command-and-control safeguards and incident reporting for nuclear forces, and whether any formal protocol addresses anomalous interference. If public, point to relevant unclassified doctrine or hearings. 


3. How AARO’s 2024 findings interface with claims in the recent hearing and with historical cases like Malmstrom. What has been independently corroborated, and what remains unverified.

Is also kinda true that even in the eu there is a non inconsiderate amount of lobbying 

https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2024.1508017/full

&gt;Analysis and diagnosis of lobbying based in Brussels

&gt;Brussels, the capital of the EU and the main seat of its institutions, hosts over 12,800 organizations that officially engage in lobbying, according to the EU’s own Transparency Register.4 These include professional federations, chambers of commerce, unions, individual entrepreneurs, banks, regions, religious organizations, and associations of all kinds. However, this number is far lower than the real figure. It is estimated that Brussels has nearly 30,000 lobbyists, almost as many as employees of the Commission (32,000).5 This makes Brussels, after Washington, the city with the highest concentration of people seeking to influence legislative processes and general political decision-making, in a unique framework of 27 states and around 500 million citizens. It could be said that parallel to the gradual increase in the political power of European institutions over the last two decades, corporate lobbying has come to “colonize” large areas of the European district of the EU capital. This has created a complex universe that, until recently, was beyond the understanding of many activists. This complexity lies, of course, in the fact that lobbying activity often spreads through a multi-level strategy in order to build stronger legitimacy (Ridao, 2017, 2018).

So, is there any initiative that we can make to the governments of the world to solve the problems of ai/stop ai in it's tracks?

1mmk7nx,What are the geopolitical implications of the U.S. placing a $50M bounty on Nicolás Maduro?,"Summary of Event:
The U.S. Department of Justice has announced a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Officials allege his involvement in narcoterrorism and international drug trafficking. This figure is unprecedented for a sitting head of state.

AP article:
https://archive.today/2025.08.10/https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-bounty-2f8e1b5e67c7f0bb8e2f9a627a4b2a8d

Context:
The U.S. has long opposed Maduro’s government, citing human rights abuses and corruption. Critics argue these actions also align with strategic interests in Venezuela’s significant oil reserves. Historical parallels exist, such as the 1953 CIA-led coup in Iran over oil nationalization.

Despite sanctions and diplomatic isolation, Maduro remains in power with support from allies such as Russia, China, and Iran. Venezuelan officials have called the bounty “political propaganda” and rejected the charges.

1meac0c,How should US Olympic policy balance fairness and inclusivity for transgender athletes?,"In July 2025, the Trump administration filed a legal brief supporting the **U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee’s (USOPC)** decision to bar transgender women from competing in women’s Olympic sports, citing the **Ted Stevens Olympic &amp; Amateur Sports Act** and a February executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”

This directive is prompting national governing bodies to adjust their eligibility criteria, raising concerns that science-based fairness policies could give way to political and ideological mandates.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2023) shows the serious risks climate change and biodiversity loss pose and the need for immediate action (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/). At the same time, data from the Migration Policy Institute (https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/us-immigration-trends) and Pew Research Center (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/12/key-facts-about-u-s-immigration-policies/) highlight the complexities and importance of border enforcement for national security and the economy.

These issues are often politicized in a way that forces people to pick sides, but I’m interested in perspectives or frameworks that can integrate both concerns without forcing a choice between them.

1maqmyf,Is a European Unified Military Command a viable option to NATO?,"For decades the NATO had remained the bedrock of Western European security against the Soviets and now against the Russians.

But following the dismantling of the Soviet Union, a general environment of peace had engulfed the European capitals. 
This prompted the European decision makers to opt for the peace dividend which generally resulted in drastic cut down of military budget and diversion of the fund to other welfare projects.

https://www.europeanfiles.eu/industry/defending-europe-the-time-of-the-peace-dividend-is-finally-over

The NATO which was mostly resourced with US military personnel and infrastructure meanwhile continued to provide for European security. However the US under the Trump administration's transactional approach demanded that Europeans pay for their security. This has sparked significant concern. For Europe, traditionally aligned with NATO, the unpredictability of US policies erodes its strategic autonomy. Western European leaders are particularly dismayed by Trump's handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict and his interactions with Putin.

https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/trump-putin-call-european-leaders-zelensky

Why the Trump administration's policies, even earlier the  haphazard US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden also surprised and disappointed European military leaders within NATO. 

https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmfaff/169/report.html

Furthermore, Trump's views on Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which guarantees collective defence, have raised alarms. 
Article 5 considers an attack on one member as an attack on all, and Trump's reluctance (though as of now, he seems to have agreed to continue) to adhere to this principle has sparked debate.

I am French. 

An interview recently shocked the political spectrum. Mathilde Panot, a left-wing politician, recently raised the idea of ​​disarming the municipal police, joining them with the national police, and possibly removing video surveillance, which has never shown ""effectiveness"". 

I do not want to form a quick opinion without having concrete arguments, concrete studies, concrete examples. I will obviously find out more, but I still wanted to ask the question about this community to potentially refine elements that I would not have thought of. 

Of course, I am aware that each state has different structural parameters. The measure of one State may be ineffective in another due to various factors. 

If personalities have knowledge on this subject, I am open to opinions or constructed analyses. 

I know that, for some, the solution or the opinion to be constructed may seem completely obvious. But I am convinced that it is more complex than that, like everything.

1jztv11,Would it be feasible for the U.S. to replace some tariffs with a revenue-sharing trade model where export-reliant countries remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from U.S.-bound goods?,"  
The U.S. is currently using tariffs and trade restrictions as primary tools to influence trade relationships and protect domestic industries. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, tariffs are designed to protect local industries by making imports more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestically produced goods. However, tariffs can also increase prices for consumers and reduce national income. A 2019 study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* found that tariffs imposed by the U.S. in 2018 led to a $51 billion increase in costs for U.S. consumers and firms, and a net real income loss of $7.8 billion.² Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported in 2020 that tariffs implemented between 2018 and 2020 would reduce U.S. real GDP by 0.5% and increase average consumer prices by 0.5%, with an average household income loss of $1,277.

Would it be more effective or sustainable for the U.S. to negotiate trade access using a different mechanism — such as requiring partner countries to remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from goods exported to the U.S.?

For example, if a country exports $20B of goods to the U.S. annually and agrees to remit 1.5% from those goods, the U.S. could collect $300M without directly impacting consumer prices. This structure would maintain price stability while reinforcing the idea that access to the U.S. consumer market is a privilege with associated obligations. The exporting country is still generating tax revenue from those goods — this model would simply give the U.S. a share of the pie. It's similar to the Apple App Store: developers gain access to a massive marketplace, but pay a percentage in return.

Has any government ever implemented a model like this? Would it be practical or beneficial as an alternative to tariffs?

After replacing Trudaeu, Mark Carney called for general elections to receive ""a strong mandate to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats and negotiate 'the best deal for Canadians.'”

Since 2020, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada has grown considerably, hitting $54 billion.

It includes US government payments to countries like Serbia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia for the promotion of civil rights, gender rights, voting rights, etc. in those countries. 

Such programs are often referred to as a way for the US to project [""soft power:""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) *the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want... [through] economic and cultural influence, rather than coercion or military strength.*

One argument that often appears in commentary on this subject is that [China will supposedly swoop in and become the new ""soft power"" in these regions.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/29/congress-shutdown-us-china-ccp-soft-power-competition-biden-xi-jinping-beijing/)

1iqykxa,"At this point, based on direct evidence, how much exactly in dollars has Elon Musk saved taxpayers by eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse in the federal government (i.e. not just his/Trump's quotes, but direct evidence of specific dollar figures)?","And as a secondary question, what direct evidence is there that Musk exaggerated or was flat out wrong about fraud, waste, and abuse he claimed existed?

I've largely spent the past couple days combing through social media and the news surrounding Elon Musk's DOGE, and I have to say it's absurd how hard it is to actually verify all the claims that both sides are making in this debate. It's honestly beyond frustrating how much time it takes to attempt to be informed, and I think it's a real problem for our democracy that quality information is so hard to come by.

**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the ""Musk and Trump's are eliminating fraud, waste and abuse side""**

DOGE has done everything it could to shut down USAID, and it does seem that USAID made some questionable spending decisions (among doing some quality work as well). First, it seems they were at least negligent in preventing funds intended for aid for ending end up in the hands of terrorists such as Hamas in Palestine, the Taliban in Afghanistan, [Source](https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/04/biden-admin-terrorist-1-3-billion-trump-foreign-aid/) and Al-Qaida in Syria. [Source](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/7283?utm_source=chatgpt.com). To be clear, this happened over the course of multiple administrations, not just Biden's.

Secondly, they gave millions for different projects to an organization called Eco Alliance, before ceasing the grants when the organization was ultimately found to have run research with a lab with Wuhan, China without proper oversight. [Source](https://oversight.house.gov/release/breaking-hhs-formally-debars-ecohealth-alliance-dr-peter-daszak-after-covid-select-reveals-pandemic-era-wrongdoing/?utm)

Third, USAID did use American taxpayer funds to develop DEI initiatives abroad, including $1.5 million in Serbia for advancing DEI and economic empowerment for LGBTQI+ people [Source](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200) and $2 million for an organization that funds gender affirming care and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights in Guatemala. [Source](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/realigning-foreign-assistance-with-american-interests/7953297.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (you can argue whether this was waste/abuse, but it was done).

USAID's budget is roughly $40 billion, so you could make the case shutting it down saves taxpayers this amount - whatever we spend on foreign aid through any replacement mechanisms (foreign aid can still be distributed in other ways, like by the State Department, so it's almost certain even if USAID was totally shut down the savings would be less than $40 billion).

**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the ""Fake news/exaggeration by Musk/Trump about fraud, waste and abuse"":**

DOGE eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but according to their records, the CFPB has gotten back nearly $20 billion for American consumers who were defrauded or taken advantage of by corporations ([Records](http://consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/enforcement-by-the-numbers/)).

Musk and Trump have also claimed USAID and other federal agencies were stealing $8 million a year from taxpayers, and giving it to Politico to write positive stories about Democrats. However, Politico has provided evidence that the fees were merely subscriptions that both Republican and Democratic policy makers had with the outlet ([Article](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5290282/politico-subscriptions-usaid-x-musk-trump)).

On top of that, Musk has claimed that DOGE discovered FEMA decided to give $59 million to house immigrants in luxury hotels, instead of providing hurricane relief to Americans. But people pointed out these funds were publicly authorized by Congress separate from any disaster relief funding, and only distributed FEMA in accordance with Congress’s orders ([Post](https://x.com/David_J_Bier/status/1888976312456417373) and [Law](https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ47/PLAW-118publ47.pdf)) In other words, DOGE didn't discover anything and this was Congress’s decision not FEMA’s. And FEMA officials have said the amount spent on standard and temporary housing for migrants was $19 million in accordance with Congress’s direction. On top of that, they note 13,000 North Carolinian households stayed in hotels FEMA paid for after the hurricane, and 3,000 still remain in those hotels ([Press Release](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20250207/north-carolina-153000-families-receiving-fema-help?)).

**I'm curious what others have found on both sides of this debate. It feels like it take a village to curate the news these days, and this seems like a community that is dedicated to that sort of noble effort. Please let me know what you've found!**

1igl13j,[META] Some changes to the r/NeutralPolitics rules and additional guidance,"Dear r/NeutralPolitics users,

The mods have implemented the following changes to the [rules:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines)

* **The core question must now be in the title.** — Rule A requires a specific political question. Most submitters put it in the title, but that wasn't a requirement until now.
* **The ""request for sources"" exemption to Rule D is eliminated.** *All* submissions must now include a link to a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Submitters looking for sources are advised to include what they've found and explain why it's insufficient.
* **Submissions that take the form of ""Does this label apply?"" are explicitly prohibited.** We've long rejected such posts, because they're reductionist, which runs directly counter to the subreddit's purpose to explore issues in depth. But this policy wasn't explicitly stated in the rules until now.
* **The following guidance for Rule 2 has been added to match r/NeutralNews:**

&gt; All statements of fact must be clearly associated with a supporting source. Users can hyperlink a source for the claim (preferred), provide a footnote (^1 or [1]), or enclose the link in parentheses. If you're referencing a source in the submission or one that's already been posted in the same comment chain, please indicate that and block quote the relevant section.

**Other announcements and guidance:**

* The description of the subreddit as it appears in Reddit searches has been updated.
* Reminder: our [submission rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) don't allow polls, requests for opinion, or promotion of one's own content. 
* Did you google it? Many submitted questions can be answered with a simple web search. The subreddit itself is also searchable.
* Along those lines, our [Frequent Topics wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/frequenttopics) is a resource for discussions about issues that come up often.
* Previous META posts have good explanations of this subreddit's [origin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) [philosophy,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4wwj5n/meta_on_the_meaning_of_neutral/) and [moderation style.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qvwvw/meta_reminders_and_clarifications_about_the_rules/)

The *jus soli* form of birthright citizenship is the principle that [a person's citizenship is dictated by the location of their birth.](https://dictionary.justia.com/jus-soli) In the United States and many other countries, the concept is carried over from [British common law.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jus-soli) 

However, many people born in the US, such as enslaved people, were denied citizenship until [the 14th Amendment formally codified the right](https://www.usconstitution.net/14th-amendment-birthright-citizenship/) in 1868. Thirty years later, the [Supreme Court ruling in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._wong_kim_ark) expanded to include the US-born children of foreigners. 

On the first day of his second stint in office, President Trump issued an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) declaring future people born in the US will not be considered citizens if their mother isn't a lawful permanent resident, unless the father is a citizen or lawful permanent resident.

**Questions**

* What's the case for and against the type of territorial citizenship the administration is seeking to limit here?
* What evidence supports the need to make this change?
* Is there evidence that people granted *jus soli* citizenship in the 127 years since *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* have been a net detriment or benefit to the country?

1htk1xj,How to improve net fiscal impact of immigration ?,"A recent published study by the  respected ""Institute of Labor Economics"", sheds light on the fiscal contributions of immigrants in the Netherlands over their lifetimes. It offers some intriguing insights that raise important questions for discussion. The data show that labor migrants, particularly from Western countries, tend to contribute positively to public finances, with an average lifetime contribution of €42,000. In contrast, non-Western immigrants often face challenges, resulting in an average fiscal deficit of €167,000 over their lifetime. Native Dutch citizens, by comparison, contribute an average of €98,000.  
Interestingly, even the second-generation immigrants that achieved education levels similar to native citizens, their earnings still lag behind, maintaining negative fiscal contributions.

This makes wonder: why it happens ? Do we need to revisit how newcomers are integrated into the labor market, ensuring they have the opportunities to contribute more effectively ?  
This study doesn’t provide all the answers but serves as a starting point for constructive dialogue. 

What policies have been implemented to enhance the economic impact of immigration and what's the evidence for their efficacy?

1gy5kjg,What are the pros and cons of eliminating the US Department of Education?,"**Background:**

The [DoEd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education) was split off in 1979 to manage programs that were already Congressionally mandated. Its [tasks are limited,](https://www.kcra.com/article/trump-shut-down-department-of-education-heres-why/62887479) because education in the United States is largely funded at the state and local level.

&gt; Some of the Department of Education’s biggest jobs are to administer federal funding appropriated by Congress to K-12 schools and manage the federal student loan and financial aid programs. [...]

&gt; But federal funding typically accounts for roughly just 10% of all school funding because the rest comes from state and local taxes.

The incoming Trump administration has a stated goal of eliminating the department.

**Questions:**

* What are the reasons to keep and eliminate the Department of Education?
* In the event that the department is shut down, who is proposed to administer the Congressionally mandated programs it handles now?
* What, if any, are the projected savings of eliminating the department?

1guw3ls,Is NATO still a credible deterrent? What are the arguments for and against?,"**Background:**

The [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) (NATO) is an intergovernmental military alliance of 32 member states. At the core of its deterrent functions is [Article 5,](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm) whose collective defense principles mean that an attack on one ally is considered as an attack against all allies. Article 5 has long been considered a successful deterrent to aggression in Europe, at first countering the Warsaw Pact countries, and later Russia.

But things changed with the rise of Donald Trump, who has been [openly critical of NATO.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/us/politics/trump-nato.html) It was widely reported that soon after Trump took office, NATO's mutual defense obligations were explained to him and he responded, ""You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?"" adding, ""That’s crazy."" Just the suggestion that the United States could not be depended on would compromise the value of such an alliance, but in 2020, Trump went a step further, reportedly [telling the European Commission President,](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vow-never-help-europe-attack-thierry-breton/) ""You need to understand that if Europe is under attack we will never come to help you and to support you."" He then added, ""By the way, NATO is dead, and we will leave, we will quit NATO.""

Now, despite Russia [annexing part of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and fomenting a war in Donbas,](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/countering-russian-aggression-twenty-first-century/) all prior to [invading Ukraine in 2022,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) nine NATO countries have still [not met their recommended military funding targets.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/whos-at-2-percent-look-how-nato-allies-have-increased-their-defense-spending-since-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) And after nearly three years of war in Ukraine with an intensive [sanctions regime against Russia,](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls?lang=en) weapons production in NATO countries still [lags way behind Russia.](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/11/the-scale-of-russia-s-rearmament-has-nato-worried_6681537_4.html#)

On the other hand, NATO countries still have the [nuclear umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella) that didn't extend to Ukraine. Some argue this alone, with some updating, would be [enough to deter aggression.](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2023/09/29/the-urgent-imperative-to-maintain-natos-nuclear-deterrence/index.html)


**Questions:**

* Is NATO still a credible deterrent?
* Are member countries right to doubt the commitment of other members, especially the U.S., to Article 5?
* Is it appropriate for [smaller countries to have a credible fear](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-why-the-baltic-states-on-natos-frontline-with-russia-are-urging-their-allies-to-wake-up-13084332) that the rest of NATO would not come to its aid if attacked?
* In a NATO with less political commitment and military industrial output than Russia, is the nuclear umbrella still a sufficient deterrent?",nosecohn,NeutralPolitics,1732019712.0,40,74,https://reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1guw3ls/is_nato_still_a_credible_deterrent_what_are_the/,[],reddit_hot

For a long time now, I have wondered why people don't pay attention to the bills going through Congress. None of my family members read them. There were few people that went looking; mostly political wonks like me. Well, over the last few months I started creating podcast style summaries of these bills and posting them online. It's been an interesting journey, mainly because the people that listen are 50+. 

The analytics over the last few months has gotten me to believe that the only people that will ever care about what is happening in our government are older folks. Maybe it is my approach, maybe it is my inept titles and thumbnails. Whatever it is, I'll keep trying to get people to pay attention. 

If anyone has feedback, it's much appreciated.

1nozi4f,Senator Ted Cruz and Rep. Ralph Norman have proposed an Amendment to the Constitution that would Limit Terms in Congress,"Hello!

I wanted to make this post because I believe our nation is in desperate need for Term Limits in Congress as the first step to ending Career Politicians and promoting a rotation in office that will better represent the will of the people of the United States of America. 

As a lifelong Democrat, I was VERY surprised to see Senator Ted Cruz proposing something I believe in so heavily, chalk that up to modern performative politics taking over everything we see in the news. As it turns out, this is he and Rep. Norman's *fifth* attempt at getting this Amendment through Congress since 2017. I found it by chance researching something tangentially related, and I found almost no coverage of the last four attempts. That inspired me to take action and try spreading the word. 

I would like to call upon others to do the same. Make this Amendment a national conversation. Get Congress acknowledging it exists, get the people riled up to support at least debate on the topic. Contact your Representatives and Senators voicing support, if you do support the idea. If you don't, I'd love to hear why and have a conversation about it!

I highly encourage sending both digital messages and real letters to those who represent you! I''m sure this is common knowledge at this point, but you can find your Senators' and Representative's contact information here:
https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member

If you're so inclined, I've set up a page on Congress Letters (a website dedicated to making sending real letters to Congress more accessible through all in one mailing services, AI letter writing services, and campaign pages like the one below) giving a bit more as to why I support this and a means to quickly send a letter to your Senators and Representatives. If you're so inclined, feel free to share it around! 
 https://congressletters.com/campaigns/supporting-an-amendment-to-limit-congressional-terms?via=andrew-a-cunningham

NOTE: The service provides Campaign Makers a portion of the proceeds (unfortunately, there is a charge for sending letters through it), I intend to use any proceeds I may get to send additional letters on this topic specifically. It's something like $1 per person who sends letters. If by some miracle this page actually starts bringing in a significant amount, I'll begin posting evidence of the proceeds going toward this cause specifically and solely.

1mq2g7z,What’s Up Next for Congress?,"Hey there, r/Congress! I’m wonder what issues people think are likely to be discussed in Congress when they return from August recess on Sept. 2. The budget, sure, but more specifically…

What do you think they’re most LIKELY to formally debate? What might they actually act on, with an up or a down vote?

I’m also curious what you WISH they’d address, and whether this list overlaps with the first.

I’ve also asked this on related threads like r/Centrists and r/Congressional_Debate to see if the list differs. I will try to share a summary before Sept 2, so we can see if people’s predictions are generally on the mark, or if events unfold in surprising ways.
