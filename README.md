## Introduction

Legislative processes are notoriously difficult to predict, yet accurate forecasting of bill outcomes has significant value for advocacy groups, businesses, and researchers. This project develops a data-driven approach to predict the passage probability and timeline of congressional bills using publicly available data sources. By combining traditional political science variables with modern NLP techniques applied to bill text and media coverage, we aim to create a real-time legislative intelligence system that outperforms existing prediction methods.
